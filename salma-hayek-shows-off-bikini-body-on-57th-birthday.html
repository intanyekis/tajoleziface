Happy 57th birthday to me!!! 🎉.”</p><p>The swimsuit is the <a href=#>Despi Cotton Chain</a> bikini in Fraise, which retails for $163. The two-piece, part of their 2023 collection, was handmade in Brazil. She topped off the look with silver sunglasses and a straw hat.</p><p>Several of Hayek Pinault’s famous pals commented on her photos with birthday wishes. “Goals! Happy birthday!! ❤️,” <a href=#><strong>Bella Thorne</strong></a> wrote.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Viola Davis</strong></a> added, “Happiest of birthdays.”</p><p>“Happy birthday gorgeous,” Priyanka Chopra chimed in.</p><p>Hayek Pinault’s birthday photos are the latest in a<a href=#> long string</a> of <a href=#>summer beach photos</a>. Leading up to her birthday, she shared several photos from Mexico that showed her <a href=#>soaking up the sun</a> and <a href=#>frolicking in the sand</a>, clearly enjoying the last days of summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Salma-Hayek-Shows-Off-Fierce-Bikini-Body-During-on-57th-Birthday-I-m-So-Happy-to-Be-Alive-317.jpg><p>She also celebrated National Bikini Day on July 5 with a photo of herself standing in a pool while donning swimwear. “Happy #NationalBikiniDay! 👙Can you believe the bikini has only been around for 77 years?! Let’s hope they don’t ban them too #notathrowback,” she captioned the Instagram post.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Hayek Pinault confidently poses in bikinis on social media, she also is embracing signs of age. The actress showed off her gray roots in a July 27 photo. “Here is a tip to cover your white hair without dyeing it … don’t wear your glasses 👓 on your hair!!! 😜😹. Bring on the wisdom🦉,” she joked.</p><p>The Eternals star previously opened up about aging in a 2021 episode of <a href=#>Red Table Talk.</a> “You can kick ass at any age,” Hayek Pinault said. “You can hold your own at any age, you can dream at any age, you can be romantic at any age. We have the right to be loved for who we are at the place that we are. We’re not just here to make babies, we’re not just here to baby the man. We’re not just here to service everything and everyone around us and then when the kids go away … it’s almost like expiration date for the eggs means an expiration date for you as a woman. It’s a misunderstanding that has been going around for centuries.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGasmZyirm60wLKcpGWjnby4v4yonZ9lkp64qrrIZpmonKlivK95lHCroWWSnr%2B1tMOasGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
