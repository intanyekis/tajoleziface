Even people in small towns are sick of violence,” she wrote. “There’s nothing small-town or American about promoting violence. You should know that better than anyone having survived a mass shooting.”</p><p>She added: “This is not American or small town-like. It’s just lame.”</p><p>Included in her post was a screenshot of Jason’s lyrics. “Got a gun that my granddad gave me / They say one day they’re gonna round up / Well, that s–t might fly in the city, good luck,” he sings in the track. “Try that in a small town / See how far ya make it down the road / You cross that line, it won’t take long / For you to find out, I recommend you don’t / Try that in a small town.”</p><p>Conversation surrounding <a href=#>the pro-gun anthem</a> — which was initially released in May — began after the release of its music video on Friday, July 14. Some fans acknowledged that <a href=#>the sensitive subject matter</a> came as a surprise given Jason’s own experience involving mass shootings.</p><p>In 2017, the country singer was <a href=#>performing in Las Vegas</a> when a gunman opened fire in the audience. The incident left 58 people dead and another 546 injured.</p><p>Jason addressed the controversy via Twitter on Tuesday, <a href=#>defending his songwriting</a>. “In the past 24 hours I have been accused of releasing a pro-lynching song (a song that has been out since May) and was subject to the comparison that I (direct quote) was not too pleased with the nationwide BLM protests. These references are not only meritless, but dangerous,” he wrote, responding to claims that the lyrics promote racist ideology.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sheryl-Crow-Slams-Jason-Aldean-Pro-Gun-Anthem-as-He-Receives-Support-From-Wife-Brittany-Aldean-2.jpg><p>He added: “There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it- and there isn’t a single video clip that isn’t real news footage -and while I can try and respect others to have their own interpretation of a song with music- this one goes too far.”</p><p>While fans and some fellow songwriters slammed Jason’s song, he received a <a href=#>public showing of suppor</a>t from his wife. “Never apologize for speaking the truth❣️🇺🇸,” Brittany, 35, captioned an <a href=#>Instagram</a> post on Tuesday alongside a selfie of the couple.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The pair, who have been married since 2015, <a href=#>previously weathered controversy in August 2022</a> after Brittany shared transphobic comments via social media. The scandal sparked a lengthy feud between the Aldeans and <a href=#><strong>Maren Morris</strong></a>, a vocal LGBTQ+ ally.</p><p>“People can cowardly hide behind their phone screens,” Morris, 33, said <a href=#>during a September 2022 episode</a> of the “I’m Listening” podcast. “I totally feel for the kids that are dealing with that because I’m where I’m at and I still deal with that. … I can sleep at night knowing that I’m always trying to be a better person.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJWnxq15wqumsGWjoa6uv4yjmKynnmKurbDEmqVmq5%2BjtG7DyJ%2BcZpqinsG1rc2yZKydnpnAbr%2FUqaeoqqRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
