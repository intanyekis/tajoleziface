On Friday, February 21, the cast of <a href=#>Modern Family</a> filmed their final episode and <a href=#>wrapped the series after 11 seasons</a>.</p><p>The sitcom, which launched on ABC in 2009, has an all-star cast <a href=#>who quickly became a family</a>: <a href=#><strong>Sofia Vergara</strong></a> (Gloria Delgado-Pritchett), <a href=#><strong>Eric Stonestreet</strong></a> (Cameron Tucker), <strong>Ed O’Neill</strong> (Jay Pritchett), <a href=#><strong>Sarah Hyland</strong></a> (Haley Dunphy), <a href=#><strong>Julie Bowen</strong></a> (Claire Dunphy), <a href=#><strong>Jesse Tyler Ferguson</strong></a> (Mitchell Pritchett), <a href=#><strong>Ty Burrell</strong></a> (Phil Dunphy), <a href=#><strong>Ariel Winter</strong></a> (Alex Dunphy), <a href=#><strong>Nolan Gould</strong></a> (Luke Dunphy), <strong>Jeremy Maguire</strong> (Joe Prichett) and <strong>Rico Rodriguez</strong> (Manny Delgado).</p><p>From the start, <a href=#>the show began breaking barriers</a> on TV — especially with Mitch and Cameron.</p><p>“I do think putting a gay couple in the forefront and not having it be a sidekick [but] having it be an integrated part of the family and <a href=#>not leading with the fact that they’re gay</a> [was] revolutionary back then,” Ferguson told reporters in January 2020 during the Television Critics’ Association’s winter press tour. “I don’t think it’s as revolutionary now, which I think is a great thing.
