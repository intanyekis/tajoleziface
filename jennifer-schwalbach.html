Apparently, Kevin was practicing with Chris Rock and was scheduled to meet with a US Today journalist. Chris Rock left the room after a few sessions and Kevin heard a knock on his door soon after Rock’s departure. When he opened the door, Kevin was faced with Jennifer Schwalbach, a drop-dead gorgeous beauty, who Kevin thought was one of the bar hookers. And given USA Today’s tendency to send in old reporters for interviews, Kevin was quite shocked to see Jennifer. Fast forward to today, and the duo has enjoyed a marriage for over two decades.

Not much is known about Jennifer’s life and the former reporter has kept details on her parents, siblings, and early life under wraps.

While the pair are often concerned with secrets and privacy, Smith decided to bare it all in the 20th Anniversary post dedicated to his wife. The actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recounted</a> the story of how the pair first met and Smith thought that Jennifer was a hooker when she knocked on his door.&nbsp;</p><p>“So [Chris] Rock and I rehearse and as he’s leaving, I tell him I’m doing an interview with USA Today next and that I feel weird that it’s in my hotel room,” Smith writes. “Rock jokes ‘Better here than the bar downstairs. It’s filled with hookers!’ Ten minutes after Rock left, there was a knock on my door. When I answered it, a stunning young woman roughly my age was standing there. And because up to that point, anyone I’d ever been interviewed by at USA Today has been in their late 40’s, the first thought that ran through my head when I saw the face of my future wife was ‘Oh no! Chris Rock sent a hotel bar hooker to my room!'”</p><p>Jennifer didn’t seem to mind the story and the pair tied the knot on April 25, 1999. As she walk down the aisle she was already pregnant with their daughter Harley Quinn Smith who was born on June 26, 1999.
