According to Houston Police, an unidentified man went so far as to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">pull a gun</a> on employees Monday (Sept. 2) night.</p><p>Police were called to the location shortly after 9 p.m. local time. The alleged incident occurred after the group, comprised of two women, three men and a baby, rolled through the drive-thru only to be informed of the chicken sandwich shortage. The hungry crew supposedly hopped out of the vehicle (leaving the baby behind) and attempted to get inside the restaurant. Thankfully, an employee was able to lock the door. One of the angry customers brandished a gun before the group fled.</p><p>Police have yet to track down the man with the gun, but are hoping that surveillance footage will help track him down. The run-in would be considered “aggravated assault” since the man essentially “threatened” employees, said&nbsp;Lt. Larry Crowson of the HPD.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Southeast officers are at 7100 Scott.
