The 'SNL' alum has been garnering headlines ever since reports of his signing up for the CBS reality show. He's also bagged a role in 'The Middle' (ABC) and if anyone has seen Kattan over the years, he's going to be quite a handful when the reality show begins this February.</p><p>The comedian shot to fame with ' in 1996 and at the height of his career was also a short-lived romance. Kattan was married to model Sunshine Deia Tutt briefly before the pair called it quits. Kattan has not married since then. Tutt has quite the CV in Hollywood starring in 'Monkeybone' and 'Sunset Tan' among other shows.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/334c82bf-c03e-4580-a92e-db0789674f60.73010155><h2 class=split>Who is Sunshine Deia Tutt?</h2><p>Tutt, born and raised in Brownsville, Texas is a model who also had a brief acting stint. She was engaged to Kattan in 2006 on Christmas Eve at her grandparents' home in Texas, however, it was their marriage that ended just two months after they tied the knot. The couple were married at Yosemite Valley in 2008 and was attended by a close group that included Will Ferrell, Jimmy Fallon, Brooke Shields, and Charlie Sheen. According to Closer Weekly, the comedian had planned for something special.</p><p>“Originally I was going to do something very special,” he told People in 2007. “I tried to get Bono of U2 to serenade her. That didn’t happen. Then I asked Justin Timberlake. No answer. After hundreds of phone calls and text messages, I finally ended up asking one of the members of the Hanson group. He didn’t want to get involved.” It was a pity that their marriage didn't last as the divorce was finalized in 2009. Since then, Tutt has been focussing on Sublime Interior Designs, her interior decor company.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kattan will be now seen in 'Celebrity Big Brother'. The official synopsis reads: "CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER follows a group of celebrities living together in a house outfitted with over 80 HD cameras and over 100 microphones recording their every move 24 hours a day and having no contact with the outside world. Each week, one or more Celebrity Houseguests will be voted out of the house, with the last remaining Houseguest receiving the grand prize of $250,000. CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER is produced by Emmy Award-winning producer Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan for Fly on the Wall Entertainment, in association with Endemol Shine North America."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom5WhsqO%2ByK2wZpqZnHqjvs6tn56qXaiyor%2FOp2RsZZOdv6q%2FjKSYrayRo3qmxIywoJ%2BdXajCr7%2FHoqWeZZSatqJ5066rrQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
