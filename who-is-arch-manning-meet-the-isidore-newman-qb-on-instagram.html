He is currently living in his hometown New Orleans, Louisiana.</p><p>Manning owns quite the requisite frame with a good height of 6 ft 4 in.</p><p>His listed weight is 215 lb (98 kg).</p><p>He made his mark on the football scene before high school when highlights of his passing became viral on Twitter. In his freshman season (19-20), Manning was the varsity starter at quarterback, shining in his debut and leading Newman to a 26-point victory. Manning was named MaxPreps National Freshman of the Year after finishing his freshman season with 2,438 yards and 34 touchdowns. Manning started the season as a sophomore by passing for six touchdowns, followed by two more touchdowns in his national television debut game against Booker T. Washington.</p><p>He is known for his excellent throwing on the move, effective throws across his body on the run, quick, smooth, repeatable delivery, and for always being on top of the ball especially, in the short-to-intermediate passing game. Considered as an elite QB prospect among the nation’s top recruits in the 2023 class, he might be a multi-year impact starter at the Power Five level, according to the recruiting analyst.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-arch-manning-parents></span>Who are Arch Manning parents?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arch Manning is the son of Cooper Manning and his wife, whose name is not mentioned. Manning is the grandson of former New Orleans Saints quarterback Archie Manning, and the nephew of NFL legends Peyton and Eli Manning. Considering these facts he is regarded as a football royalty on bloodlines alone.</p><p>However, his dad Cooper, who was an all-star wide receiver in high school, was forced to retire from the sport after being diagnosed with spinal stenosis. However, he has managed to live a fine life working as an anchor of Fox Sports’ The Manning Hour and a director of investor relations at AJ Capital Partners.</p><p>According to Archie Manning, arch manning is well ahead of both of his uncles since, Peyton and Eli Manning had to wait until their sophomore seasons to take over as lead quarterback at Newman, while, Manning began his freshman season as the starting quarterback.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=arch-manning-estimated-net-worth-and-salary></span>Arch Manning estimated Net Worth and Salary<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arch Manning has already established himself as one of the most talked-about high school football recruiters in the industry’s history. Per Darren Rovell, an eminent sports business analyst predicts that manning could make as much as $10 million as a freshman, and also his earnings will skyrocket if he lives up to the hype.</p><p>His name “Manning” is in itself sufficient to bring in the potential endorsement deals. Similarly, everyone who had Peyton and Eli will be willing to sign him, if he keeps on giving his astounding performance. His college offer has already started to flow in and Arch will have massive endorsement agreements coming his way from the moment he commits to a program.</p><p>By the end of his undergraduate career, he might be the highest-paid college athlete in the country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4yaqZygXaKur7rIp55mpZWawW7Ax55koquZmbyzsYynnLClkaN6sq6MqKVmoZ6owaKz0ZqkaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
