During his stint in Season 15, Herren’s gameplay was quite underwhelming on the show, but he still managed to bring home the $500,000 grand prize.</p><p>Prior to joining the hit reality TV show, Herren worked as a professor. And after leaving the program as the winner, he drew flak after he made some inappropriate comments about his female housemates.</p><h2 id=dick-donato-net-worth-300-000>Dick Donato – Net Worth $300,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dick Donato is one of the <a href=#>most controversial contestants in Big Brother history</a>. He was part of Season 8, and he was also crowned as the winner back then.</p><p>What made his seasons memorable was the fact that Donato beat out his daughter, Daniele in the final 2. The father and daughter, who competed as separate entities, returned to Big Brother in Season 13.</p><p>Despite the criticisms that he has received, Donato is still very much a part of the Big Brother world. He hosts his own recap show titled Dick at Night, which has most definitely contributed to his net worth.</p><h2 id=lisa-donahue-net-worth-500-000>Lisa Donahue – Net Worth $500,000</h2><p>Lisa Donahue starred in Big Brother Season 3. She is the first woman to ever win on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Prior to joining the reality TV show, Donahue worked as a bartender.

She also returns to Big Brother to either host segments or interviews the contestants, which has contributed to her impressive net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-franzel-net-worth-1-million>Nicole Franzel – Net Worth $1 million</h2><p>Who can forget Nicole Franzel? The unassuming and seemingly innocent contestant that joined Big Brother in Season 16. Back then, Franzel didn’t manage to bring home the grand prize, but luck was on her side when she returned to the show in Season 18.</p><p>Franzel also happened to be the <a href=#>first female houseguest to beat a male player</a> in the final two.</p><p>And just last season, Franzel once again returned to Celebrity Big Brother. She managed to get far in the competition, but she lost to Cody Calafiore.</p><p>Calafiore’s decision to bring Enzo Palumbo to the finals drew a slew of mixed reactions. Big Brother fans and Calafiore himself were aware that bringing Franzel to the final two would have cost him his $500,000.</p><h2 id=hayden-moss-net-worth-2-million>Hayden Moss – Net Worth $2 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hayden Moss is the winner of Big Brother Season 12.
