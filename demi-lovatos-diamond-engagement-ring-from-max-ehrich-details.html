And today that word makes perfect sense again but today I’m officially going to be someone else’s partner.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Demi-Lovato-Engagement-Ring-From-Max-Ehrich-Inline.jpg><p>The bauble was designed by Peter Marco and according to a source, the center stone was from a family necklace before. Another person told Us that Ehrich got the ring sponsored.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brilliant Earth</a>’s SVP of merchandising Kathryn Money estimates that the 8-carat emerald cut diamond is set on a platinum or white-gold band, with smaller trapezoid-shaped accent diamonds framing it. She estimates that the entire weight of the ring is somewhere between 9.5 and 11.5 carats. This would put the price roughly around half a million.</p><p>“We’ve continued to see emerald cut engagement rings surge in popularity. In fact, you’ll see this shape adorn the fingers of celebrities including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jennifer</strong> <strong>Lopez,</strong></a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong></a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nikki Bella</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Alex Guarnashelli</strong></a>,” she told Us. “Many opt for elongated diamonds – including emeralds, elongated cushions and ovals – as their shape offers a flattering look, lengthening the wearer’s finger. As we see delicate settings trending, the thicker band gives Demi’s ring a traditional, timeless touch.”</p><p>In March 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us confirmed </a>that the duo was dating when a source close to Ehrich revealed that the relationship was off to a strong start. Then Us <a href=#>exclusively reported </a>that the Emmy-nominated actor had “plans to propose to Demi after this whole pandemic is resolved,” adding that both “families wouldn’t be surprised by the proposal.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities’ street style ‘dos (and don’ts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5myrrWMpaavmaSkwG6wyJqkqKaUYrKvs8CgnKadnql6s7XNoGSfqp%2Bieq6t12acoaqZmLVusMStmKKko2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
