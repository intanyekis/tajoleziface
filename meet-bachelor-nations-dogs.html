(Underwood has since <a href=#>welcomed pups Zooka and Scout</a> into his brood.)</p><p>Fletcher, meanwhile, previously told Us Weekly that her and <a href=#><strong>Jordan Rodgers</strong></a>‘ dog, Jackson, will have a role in their nuptials. “Jackson will be at the wedding somewhere, but he won’t be in the wedding,” the season 12 Bachelorette <a href=#>explained in July 2019</a>. “Jackson will be there with someone.”</p><p class=p1>The Texas native and Rodgers, who also share pup Jagger, <a href=#>eventually wed in May 2022</a> after p<a href=#>ostponing their nuptials amid the coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p><p>Bristowe, for her part, adopted two adorable golden doodles with fiancé <a href=#><strong>Jason Tartick.</strong></a></p><p>“MERRY CHRISTMAS TO US!! Ramen has a new brother 😍😍. MEET PINOT. Pinot was found in a kill shelter in South Korea and @bunnysbuddies saved him. Now he has a safe home with us,” the season 11 Bachelorette <a href=#>wrote alongside a picture of the couple and their pups</a>, Ramen and Pinot, in December 2019 via Instagram. “Pinot is a big mushy sweetheart who is somehow more cuddly than Ramen. He’s got the SOFTEST coat and the biggest heart. I know a lot of people will ask how we will do this with traveling so much. But we will make it work. This isn’t about us. This is about giving a sweet innocent pup a new life. We will continue to do what we do, and just do it with 2 instead of 1. #adoptdontshop #GoldenRetrievers #dogsofinstagram.”</p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Rachel Lindsay</strong></a>‘s dog Copper appeared alongside her on <i>The Bachelorette</i>&nbsp;season 13. The&nbsp;<i>Miss Me With That&nbsp;</i>author — who wed Bryan Abasolo in August 2019 — made it clear to her suitors that<a href=#> they needed to win over her faithful pooch first</a>.</p><p class=p1>“@kingcopperash&nbsp;was found in the streets of Dallas by my sister&nbsp;@constancecherones&nbsp;over 4 years ago,” Lindsay wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in December 2020. “She took him to the vet but he wasn’t chipped and didn’t have tags. She posted about him on a website and no one claimed him. A foster dog mom offered to take him home but he escaped from her yard that night because there was a storm and he was scared.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>She added: “Another couple found him a couple of days later and contacted my sister. My sister showed me his picture and I couldn’t stop thinking about him. I went to meet him and he ran to me and touched me with his paw. Basically, he imprinted on me. At that point, I said ‘Son, come home’ and <a href=#>we have been inseparable ever since</a> that day! <span class=s1>☺️</span>&nbsp;He was always meant to be mine!”</p><p class=p1>For more of Bachelor Nation’s cutest pups, scroll below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqax02aZmpuYmrmwvoynmK2hn6PAbrDOoKpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
