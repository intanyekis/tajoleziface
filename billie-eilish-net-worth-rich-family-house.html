While that makes perfect sense since people are fascinated by the clothes that celebrities wear, the truth of the matter is that red carpet events often reveal something about most celebrities.</p><p>After all, most of the stars don’t wind up on best-dressed lists because they make extremely similar fashion choices. On top of that, when it comes to most stars, they tend to spend their money on the same kinds of things.</p><p>Of course, as anyone who has followed <a href=#><strong>Billie Eilish’s</strong></a> career since she rose to fame will be able to tell you, she is an artist who has always stood out among the crowd. After all, you would not find most stars wearing the baggy and somewhat gothic clothes that Eilish almost always wore when she first became a major star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of that, after <a href=#>Eilish underwent a notable makeover</a>, her platinum blonde hair and clothes continued to be largely unique in the celebrity world. With all of that in mind, it is fascinating to examine if Eilish also spends her $30 million net worth in ways that make her stand out among her celebrity peers.</p><p><strong>Updated on June 23, 2023:</strong> Billie Eilish has been working hard to keep her net worth on the up and up. The singer has 10 more locations booked for shows later this year, after performing at Power Our Planet: Live in Paris in France just recently. Eilish will be visiting a few spots here in America, but most of her tour dates take place in Europe, as well as one show in Canada.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Billie Eilish Confesses Her "Younger Self" Would Not "Exist" Dealing With The Level Of Negative Body-Shaming She Has Endured</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-is-billie-eilish-rsquo-s-celebrity-lifestyle-thanks-to-her-net-worth>This Is Billie Eilish’s Celebrity Lifestyle Thanks To Her Net Worth</h2><p>Even though it has often seemed like she prides herself on standing out, Billie Eilish spends some of her money on typical celebrity stuff. For example, it is no secret that a lot of celebrities spend their cash on procedures to change their look. While there is no indication that Eilish has paid for major plastic surgeries, it is well documented that she has undergone several teeth straightening procedures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/billie-eilish-looking-silly.jpg><p>In terms of the less permanent ways that Billie Eilish has changed the way she looks, the talented singer clearly seems to have a passion for designer clothes and accessories. After all, Eilish has spent a good amount of money on expensive clothes, sunglasses, jewelry, designer watches, and shoes. For example, during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Eilish could be seen wearing white <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gucci sneakers with crystals on them, worth $1,590</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Billie Eilish's Perfume Might Be The Most Impressive Product She's Launched</a></span></p><h2 id=the-biggest-items-billie-eilish-has-spent-her-money-on>The Biggest Items Billie Eilish Has Spent Her Money On</h2><p>When most people come into major amounts of money, they quickly buy a new home and car. At one time, it was believed that when Billie Eilish went car shopping, she bought the kind of ostentatious car that most celebrities of her caliber would own. After all, Eilish posted an image of herself standing in front of an obscenely expensive blue McLaren on Instagram. However, Eilish went on to delete that image, and it seems she never actually owned that vehicle.</p><p>According to reports, Eilish bought herself <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat</a>, which would have cost between $60,000 and $83,000. While the vast majority of people can’t afford to spend that kind of money on a car, that kind of price tag is very reasonable for someone with the kind of money that Billie has.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell first took the music world by storm, they have both made a fortune. With that in mind, it is not surprising that Finneas has gone down the typical Hollywood road, since he reportedly has purchased a trio of pricey homes in Los Angeles. On the other hand, it seems like Eilish did not purchase the typical celebrity real estate.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Finneas O'Connell Had A Role On Glee Before Billie Eilish Got Into The Music Business</a></span></p><p>According to a Dirt article published in October 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billie Eilish secretly bought a Glendale horse ranch for $2.3 million in 2019</a>. The article points to several pieces of evidence to support that claim. For example, in Eilish’s song “NDA” in which she reflects on the trappings of fame, the popular singer states that she “bought a secret house when I was seventeen.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of that, the ranch was bought by a trust that is linked to the building where Eilish’s business managers work, and it was purchased when Billie was seventeen. Finally, the real estate agent that represented the buyer in the transaction is the same person that Eilish’s brother has used to buy real estate in the past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/billie-eilish-looking-happy-onstage.jpg><p>Based on all of that evidence, it seems all but certain that Billie Eilish truly is the owner of the Glendale horse ranch even though she reportedly still lives with her parents in Los Angeles. According to reports, the ranch is designed for horses since it is located in a place that is zoned for the animals, and it boasts stables with four stalls, an arena, and a feed room. The property also contains a swimming pool, a sundeck, a goat pen, a paddock, a 2,100 square foot single-story ranch house, a guesthouse, and “a horse-keeper’s apartment.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZoqScnrJusciloKygXaOytXnWqKmtoF2ntqS0jJ%2BYpqGcrnqpu9SsnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
