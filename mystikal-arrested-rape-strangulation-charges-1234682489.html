The rapper reportedly accused the woman of taking $100 cash from him before punching her, pulling out her braided hair, and taking her keys and phone to keep her from leaving his residence.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The victim also stated that she called a friend to meet her at a Baton Rouge hospital after Mystikal allegedly raped her in his home. At the emergency room, a sexual assault kit was performed where doctors confirmed injuries coinciding with her description of the attack.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Mystikal is currently detained, has yet to post bond, and awaits arraignment at the Ascension Parish Jail. His bail hearing has been set for Tuesday, Aug. 2.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Before his series of very <a href=# data-type=post data-id=533293>public sexual assault allegations</a>, the 51-year-old artist came on the Hip-Hop scene in 1994 and quickly rose to fame for his stand-out hits “Shake Ya A**,” “Stutter,” and “Danger.” However, his fame has been overlooked due to his many run-ins with the law regarding sexual abuse allegations made by women.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In 2004, Mystikal was&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>sentenced to six years</a> in prison&nbsp;after pleading guilty to sexual battery. He, along with his bodyguards, allegedly forced a hairstylist to perform oral sex on all of them as an alternative for not turning her into authorities for cashing $80,000 worth of unauthorized checks from the rapper’s bank account.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Upon his release in 2010, the New Orleans native was <a href=# data-type=post data-id=242267>registered as a sex offender</a> in Louisiana. Two years later, he was&nbsp;back behind bars following a domestic abuse battery charge and violating his probation. He was charged again in August 2017 for alleged rape and sexual assault against a woman at a Shreveport casino. He was held on a $3,000,000, in which&nbsp;<a href=# data-type=post data-id=634883>charges were eventually dropped&nbsp;</a>due to lack of evidence.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Surprisingly, Mystikal has been invited to perform his biggest hits alongside Master P, Trick Daddy, Silkk the Shocker, and other “No Limit Soldiers” for the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=post data-id=1234681994>No Limit Reunion Tour </a>at Miami’s FLA Live Arena this fall. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6LGtMDIpJilZZGnv6a%2F056bZqqRpbJuv9OrmKefpaGutbXOp2ScoJGntKa%2FjGppbGxmbX91hJho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
