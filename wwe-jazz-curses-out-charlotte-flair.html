For the most part they not on a permanent basis but just for marquee shows or big moments. Take the first ever women's Royal Rumble match for example. Not only did WWE need former female Superstars to fill all 30 spots in the match but some past women also deserved to reap the rewards for the hard work they have done.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Those names have included former Superstars such as Trish Stratus, <a href=#>Lita</a>, Michelle McCool and Kelly Kelly. There's not enough room for everyone though and the likes of Victoria, Gail Kim and Kharma have not been seen on WWE television during the women's revolution. Whether that's their choice or WWE's is unclear. Another woman who has not returned is Jazz and she doesn't seem to be too happy about it.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>GAIL KIM CALLS OUT STEPHANIE MCMAHON AND THE WOMEN'S REVOLUTION</a></strong></p><p>Her Twitter tirade began with an innocent post asking fans whether they would be interested in seeing her go one on one with Charlotte Flair. Clearly Jazz got a good response as from that point on she has been going after Flair&nbsp;on Twitter in a major way trying to illicit a response. Some of the tweets feature explicit content, although you can view them here at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wrestling News Source</a>, where Jazz claims that Flair has made things personal and without her there would be no Charlotte.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The whole ordeal is currently very confusing since as far as we can tell Flair hasn't done anything to anger Jazz. The former WWE Superstar has been replying to tweets that don't involve her whatsoever, including a congratulatory tweet to Braun Strowman for winning Friday's Royal Rumble from Flair. Right now it merely feels like an attempt from Jazz to get attention from a female Superstar on WWE's payroll.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>JAZZ INFORMS FANS THAT SHE IS 'NOT FINISHED YET'</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jazz hasn't just come out of nowhere. Last week the former Women's Champion informed fans that she wasn't done yet and would be taking bookings and returning to the ring. Clearly when she said that she meant it with the intention of once again becoming a WWE Superstar. Nice idea but swearing and insulting one of the promotion's top stars for all the world to see probably isn't the best way of going about it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuipaBnp6yybrbAs7Fmm6WnwKa%2FjKisrWWTna6zuM6tq55llqGuqr6O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
