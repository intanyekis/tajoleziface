This fee falls under the category of runway charges that each airport bills for, which also includes take-off fees. There are also parking fees charged when a plane remains on the ground at an airport, usually for longer than a 2-hour turnaround time but for the purpose of this article let’s look at landing fees only.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Landing fees are based on Maximum Take Off Weight (MTOW) and not actual Take Off Weight. That means that no matter how many passengers are on the plane or how much cargo including luggage the MTOW is taken from the rating specified by the manufacturer of that particular type of plane. &nbsp;Most people tend to think of private or corporate jets falling into only one size or classification of plane but there actually five different categories of private jets. The trend today is using larger size aircraft and having it customized to suit the individual or particular company that owns it. For this reason let’s look at a common aircraft size that is used for that purpose, which is the 767-400. The MTOW of this plane is 450,000 pounds or 204,120 kilograms. These types of aircraft are commonly being used as they can easily transport groups of more than fifty and they are perfect for long range travel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Landing fees vary dramatically as you will see by our list but as they account for just one part of the expense of operating a plane you can imagine when you start to figure in hangar fees, fuel, aviation personnel, etc. just how expensive it is to own your own plane. Why are some landing fees so much more than others? Well some of it is supply and demand and some of it is just good old fashion greed. For example, in Canada and Japan a large part of the fee structure has to cover salaries of aviation executives. Let’s take a look at some of the airports with the highest landing fees rounded out to the nearest dollar.</p><h2 id=10-salzburg-airport-in-salzburg-austria-3-800><strong>10. Salzburg Airport in Salzburg, Austria: $3,800</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Salzburg Airport is the second largest international airport in Austria. It is located about a mile west of the city center and serves as a gateway for travelers coming to visit Austria’s fabulous ski areas. In 1984 Salzburg hosted the landing of an Air France Concorde as well as their first Boeing 767, which arrived from Norway. In 2012 approximately 1.6 million passengers were moved through the terminals as well as just over 17,000 flight operations. Salzburg had the designation of being the first Austrian airport to house a low-cost airline when it opened its doors to Ryanair in 2001. Low cost airline or not when you land at this airport in a 767-400 aircraft you will pay $3,800 making it number ten on our list.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-la-guardia-airport-in-new-york-united-states-3-950><strong>9. La Guardia&nbsp;Airport in New York, United States: $3,950</strong></h2><p></p><p>La Guardia Airport is a part of the New York City metropolitan area airport system along with JFK International and Newark Liberty International; they serve as the largest airport system in the United States in terms of passenger traffic and first in the world in terms of total flight operations. La Guardia handled over 26 million passengers in 2013. It serves as a hub for Delta Airlines and American Airlines. The airport has been widely criticized for being outdated and pilots jokingly refer to it as the “USS La Guardia” because the runways are so short and it’s surrounded by water giving them the feel of having to land on an aircraft carrier. Yet, to land at this airport you will pay $3,950 making it number nine on our list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-dublin-airport-in-dublin-ireland-4-100><strong>8. Dublin Airport in Dublin, Ireland: $4,100</strong></h2><p>Dublin Airport is located about 5 miles north of the city center. Over 19 million passengers passed through this airport in 2012 making it the busiest of Ireland’s airports. It is followed next by the Belfast International Airport. It is the major hub of Ireland’s flag carrier, Aer Lingus as well as Aer Arann and Ryanair. The Dublin airport also offers United States border preclearance services making it one of only two European airports with this designation. Landing a 767-400 here will cost $4,100 in landing fees.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-ch-bu-centrair-international-airport-in-nagoya-japan-4-300><strong>7. Chūbu Centrair International Airport in Nagoya, Japan: $4,300</strong></h2><p><b></b></p><p>Nagoya Airport used to be the main airport until the opening of Chubu International Airport in 2005. The airport is located on an artificial island on Ise Bay. It is 22 miles south of the city of Nagoya in central Japan. The airport is the main international gateway for the area and is Japan’s third offshore airport, the second built on a man-made island. When the airport opened in 2005 it took over almost all of the existing flights from the old airport now designated Nagoya Airfield. It also took over cargo shipments from Tokyo and Kansai as well. It is a hub for Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways. At a cost of $4,300 to land here it is number seven on our list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-bristol-airport-in-bristol-england-4-400><strong>6. Bristol Airport in Bristol, England: $4,400</strong></h2><p>Bristol Airport was built on the site of a former Royal Air Force field and used to be known as Bristol International Airport. In 2013, it was the ninth busiest airport in the United Kingdom, handling over 6.1 million passengers. It serves as a hub for EasyJet, Ryanair and BMI Regional Airlines. Until 2010, aircraft had to park on the apron and passengers either walked or were carried by bus to their flights. In May of 2010 a walkway on the west side of the terminal building was built connecting it to eight new pre-boarding zones, reducing the need for buses. Obviously not the most modern airport and yet to land here in a 767-400 it will cost the equivalent of $4,400 USD making it number six on our list.</p><p></p><h2 id=5-darwin-international-airport-in-darwin-australia-4-600><strong>5. Darwin International Airport in Darwin, Australia: $4,600</strong></h2><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Darwin International Airport is located in Darwin, Australia and shares its runways with the Royal Australian Air Force base located in Darwin. It’s the 10th busiest airport in Australia serving 26,036 flights and 1,743,734 passengers in 2011. An interesting fact about Darwin Airport is that when the Concorde flights were still in service they utilized Darwin International Airport when flying to Australia as they had one of the only runways long enough to handle them. Darwin International Airport serves Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia Airlines. With a landing fee of $4,600 this airport comes in at number five on our list.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-toronto-pearson-international-airport-in-toronto-canada-5-200><strong>4.
