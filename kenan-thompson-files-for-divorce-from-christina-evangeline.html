There’s nothing juicy about why they split.”</p><p>The former couple reportedly came to a “mutual decision” regarding their initial separation, citing growing apart and “wanting different things” as the reason behind the original split.​</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kenan-Thompson-Files-For-Divorce-From-Christina-Evangeline-After-Split-002.jpg><p>While the two have been separated for a year and a half, the <a href=#>All That alum</a> saw his wife “almost every day still,” with the duo “[going] to dinners just the two of them” often, the source told Us.</p><p>The former couple dated for three years <a href=#>before marrying at Atlanta’s Georgia Aquarium</a> in November 2011. The couple were married for three years before welcoming daughter Georgia in 2014 and daughter Gianna in 2018.</p><p>The Kenan star has previously gushed about about <a href=#>his “big happy family,”</a> even flying back to Saturday Night Live a day after his wedding to provide for them.</p><p>“We wanted to get married and we wanted to start a family and keep a family,” the Ohio native told <a href=#>Fatherly</a> in February 2021. ”That’s probably what drives me to work like such a maniac.”</p><p>No matter their relationship status, the parents will stay present in their children’s lives.</p><p>Evangeline has been quiet when it comes to discussing her family but couldn’t help but share the news about the arrival of her second daughter.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m usually private when it comes to these personal things, but we have less than 5 days until this little girl is due and I am just TEW excited,” she posted via Instagram in July 2018.</p><p>The actress also opened up about proud she was when daughter Georgia joined Thompson as a guest judge on <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> in 2020.</p><p>“I’ve always had a really hard time processing things like this (like, wut?) lol I didn’t even know that this was happening until texts started coming in&nbsp;🥴&nbsp;but Georgia’s the best with it,” Evangeline shared at the time. “Mommy, did you see me steal the show?
