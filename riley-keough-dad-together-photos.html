Riley was ruled as the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> sole owner of her estate</a> in May. After the settlement, Priscilla <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed a declaration</a> saying she believes that her late husband would be pleased with the decision, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;“My daughter’s passing was both devastating and heartbreaking. We have learned that the fans realize that we are ‘Just a Family,'” she wrote. “My granddaughter, through her counsel, along with my team worked diligently and tirelessly to resolve all misunderstandings as a family.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Lisa Marie was married to Danny from 1988 to 1994.
