From <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Scott Foley</strong></a> and more, the actress takes her time in the romance department and really commits.</p><p>After many years of dating in the public eye, the 13 Going on 30 star opened up about the <a href=#>struggles that come with finding love in the spotlight.</a></p><p>“If it’s true and you are starting to be serious with someone and they start saying, ‘Well, when are they gonna be engaged?’ It’s almost like you just want to get there so that you can complete that and just maybe it will die down for a second,” she said during an October 2020 episode of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Tell Me More With Kelly Corrigan&nbsp;show. “And then it’s immediately, ‘Trouble in paradise.’ And it becomes almost a self-fulfilling prophecy.”</p><p>The Golden Globe winner’s first public beau was Scott Foley, who she met while guest starring on Felicity in 1998. The pair wed in 2000 and separated in March 2003.</p><p>Garner <a href=#>opened up about the four-year marriage</a> in an interview with Allure&nbsp;more than a decade later.</p><p>“We didn’t have a shot,” she said in August 2013. “He’s a really good guy, and we just imploded.”</p><p>The actress’ most high-profile romance, however, took place&nbsp;when she wed Ben Affleck in June 2005. The pair went public with their relationship&nbsp;in October 2004, less than&nbsp;one&nbsp;year after the Argo producer called off his engagement with&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>.</p><p>After welcoming three children&nbsp;—&nbsp;Violet, Seraphina and Samuel&nbsp;—&nbsp;the couple <a href=#>announced their split one day after their 10th anniversary</a> in June 2015. Although Garner <a href=#>referred to the actor as the “love of my life”</a> in a February 2016 Vanity Fair interview, she <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> in April 2017.</p><p>A source revealed to Us Weekly in May 2020 that the couple had <a href=#>“worked hard to get to a good place”</a> in the years since their breakup, especially amid Affleck’s <a href=#>struggles with his sobriety</a>.</p><p>The Yes Day actress is “always polite and trusts Ben and lets him do what he wants when he’s with the kids,” the insider added.</p><p>Just after they<a href=#> finalized details of their divorce in October 2018</a>, Us broke the news that <a href=#>Garner&nbsp;had a new man in her life</a>: <a href=#><strong>John Miller</strong></a>. At the time,&nbsp;a source revealed that&nbsp;the pair had been dating six months. Thought they <a href=#>split in August 2020</a>,&nbsp;Us exclusively <a href=#>reported&nbsp;the couple were back together</a>&nbsp;in May 2021.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Jen and John are back on,” a source revealed&nbsp;at the time. “It started up a few weeks ago.”</p><p>Scroll to see the actress’ loves through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6a6zaKdnqpdnK6zusSrZJ2ZpJ67qHnHoqqtp6KufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
