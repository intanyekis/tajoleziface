The daughter of wealthy socialite and fashion designer Eleanor Waldorf, Blair certainly knew where to shop and has inspired many of Us with her style.</p><p>Whether she was dressed by her mom or herself, Blair was always polished to perfection. Her style was a mix of feminine, preppy, elegant, sophisticated and even sometimes spicy – very much in line with her personality. And while the clothing the affluent teenager rocked on the regular was undoubtedly expensive, we gathered up 17 fashion pieces for much, much less to get the timeless BW look.
