The actress has a beautiful relationship with her sisters and often shares photos with them.</p><p class=dh>It has been decades since Jayne Seymour began her career in the entertainment industry. Through it all, she had her family's support and guidance.</p><p class=dh>She maintained her close relationship with her sisters, who all looked alike in their younger years. The "Dr. Quinn" star recently shared a throwback photo with her siblings, Sally and Anne, celebrating their experiences and strong bond.</p><p class=dh>"Life's journey is so much fuller and richer with my sisters by my side," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CvfbkIBvEM6/>wrote</a>. "We've shared everything from tears and triumphs." Although Jane and her sisters don't live within proximity, they are <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CvfbkIBvEM6/>proud</a> that their love "always bridges the gap."</p><p class=dh>The Hollywood star previously shared <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://web.facebook.com/JaneSeymourOfficial/posts/sister-selfies-/1937196626375205/?_rdc=1&_rdr">photos</a> with them, one in 2018 and another in 2019. In one of her posts, Jane described her sisters as strong and beautiful.</p><p class=dh>In 2020, Jane and her sisters <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/B9H67qVHhoz/?hl=en">dressed as triplets</a> to honor their late mother, like they sometimes would as children. The trio donned blue Everything But Water <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8060725/TALK-TOWN-Jane-Seymour-sisters-Sally-Anne-pay-tribute-late-mother.html>maxi dresses</a> with colorful patterns on them while posing beside each other.</p><p class=dh>Although they weren't born in the same year, Jane, Sally, and Anne did look like triplets. In fact, their similarities extend beyond their appearance. In a previous interview, Jane revealed that they grew up doing the same things, wearing the same clothes, and enjoying the same experiences. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/20/jane-seymour-family-values-austenland>added</a>:</p><p class=dh>"The only difference was that I was obsessed with ballet, and they weren't. So I went to professional ballet school, and they went to a different school."</p><p class=dh>Sally and Anne live in England; the former in Kew and the latter in Richmond. Since they have their residences there, Jane always has a comfortable place to stay when she visits.</p><p class=dh>Interestingly, Anne appeared in the film "Austenland" with her sister. The director immediately thought about casting Anne when she saw her photo. "Sharing screen time with her was a lot of fun," Jane <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/20/jane-seymour-family-values-austenland>revealed</a>. "And she got really good reviews."</p><p class=dh>Jane has undoubtedly mastered her craft through the years, and working alongside her sister was a great experience.
