Amid Season 7 of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Summer House</a>&nbsp;airing on Bravo, one of the show’s stars,&nbsp;<strong>Danielle Olivera</strong>, 34, has opened up about her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>recent split</a> from chef&nbsp;<strong>Robert Sieber</strong>. “We broke up towards the end of last year,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> on Feb. 22. “It just wasn’t working out. You know, it sucks because there’s no animosity. It’s just sad, honestly, that we couldn’t figure it out.” Despite their breakup, Danielle called her ex-beau a “great person” and clarified that she has “so much respect for him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Danielle-Olivera-robert-Sieber-split-bravo-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Although the brunette beauty and Robert remain respectful of each other, the 34-year-old noted she was no longer happy on the romantic side of things. “I have so much respect for him, but the relationship side, I was becoming unhappy in it,” she added. “And expressing that unhappiness didn’t work in my favor.” In addition, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TV personality</a> stated that their careers were another reason for their relationship’s demise.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“That was the best time, when he didn’t have work!”, Danielle shared with the outlet. “I really loved spending a lot of time with him and he’s a chef, and it’s difficult <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>to date</a> a chef in general, but to date a chef that travels for his job, it takes a toll. And I’m not the easiest either. I expect a lot, and so those two things just didn’t work out.” Robert and his now-ex dated from July 2020 until November of 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In a separate interview with Bravo’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Dish</a>, Danielle detailed the timeline of their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>breakup</a> and said she does “not recommend” that timeline for anyone. “Robert and I have parted ways,” she told the outlet on Wednesday. “It happened right before <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Thanksgiving</a>, and I do not recommend a breakup right before the holidays. It is heartbreaking. It sucks. But, there’s no animosity between us. It just wasn’t working out.” She also told&nbsp;The Daily Dish&nbsp;that their careers are “stressful [and] insane”, which led to neglecting their communication skills. “We couldn’t communicate effectively, and we needed to find our own happiness, separately, unfortunately. I hope it’s for the best, but I can tell you right now, it feels really bad,” she concluded.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Although Danielle confirmed the heartbreak this week, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her co-stars</a> <strong>Lindsay Hubbard</strong>, 36, and&nbsp;<strong>Carl Radke</strong>, 38, seemingly confirmed the split in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET&nbsp;</a>via, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>&nbsp;on Feb. 10. “Danielle’s been in a relationship with Robert [Sieber] — I don’t know if it’s still currently going or not. As far as we know, they are not together is what we are told,” Carl told the outlet. “But Danielle was in a serious relationship, and she traveled around and there was no animosity about her going away.” The former pair made their last public appearance at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BravoCon</a> in Oct. 2022 (see <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos</a> above).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze5FrZqytnaKys3nHqKysnV2Zrq%2B1xKWjnmWfoba3sdGaZJunqZu%2FqrHNnWSrp5Kav7V50qKcm52iYq%2BzscCkrKln</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
