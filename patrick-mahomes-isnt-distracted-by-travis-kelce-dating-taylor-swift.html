People see the whole Taylor Swift and <a href=#><strong>Travis [Kelce</strong></a> thing] and they make it a huge deal because it is a huge deal,” Mahomes, 28, told <a href=# rel=noopener>ESPN</a> reporter <strong>Jeff Darlington</strong> in a Saturday, November 18, sit-down when asked about <a href=#>his “brother” Kelce’s</a> new romance. “I think it becomes a bigger deal to the fanbases than it does to the guys who are actually in the building.”</p><p class=p3>Swift, 33, and Kelce, 34, have been linked since September, nearly three months after the Chiefs tight end attended her <i>Eras Tour </i>concert and revealed <a href=#>he failed to exchange numbers</a> after the show. After they eventually connected, Swift <a href=#>attended the Chiefs home game</a> against the Chicago Bears.</p><p class=p3>The Grammy winner later stepped out at <a href=#>three more of Kelce’s football games</a> — and <a href=#>connected with his teammates</a>. (Swift’s game day attendance and NFL friendships have since <a href=#>received a lot of fanfare</a>, even inspiring <a href=#>a <i>Saturday Night Live </i>spoof.</a>)</p><p class=p3>“I’ve been lucky enough to meet Taylor and see how good of a person she is,” Mahomes gushed on Saturday. “I think you can understand why <a href=#>it’s not become a distraction</a> or anything like that because everybody cares about being the best they can be every day.”</p><p class=p3>Swift has often<a href=#> watched the Chiefs games</a> next to Patrick’s wife, <strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong>, and the women have since <a href=#>formed a friendship</a>. Swift even hosted <a href=#>an intimate viewing party</a> for Brittany, 28, and <a href=#>other Chiefs wives</a> at her New York City apartment when the team <a href=#>played the Miami Dolphins in Germany</a> earlier this month.</p><p class=p3>“Taylor is loving her newfound friendships with the other wives and girlfriends of Travis’ teammates,” <a href=#>a source exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i></a>in November<i>.</i> “She appreciates that they know how to have fun just like she does and she loves cheering Travis and the Chiefs on alongside all of them.”</p><p class=p3>Patrick and Brittany, high school sweethearts <a href=#>who got married in 2022</a>, were big Swifties before meeting the pop star. Like Kelce, they attended her <i>Eras </i>show when she came to Kansas City in July. Patrick is also hoping to catch another concert when the NFL season ends.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>“We’ll see when we get to the off-season, maybe I’m traveling to Europe to go to a concert or something,” Patrick quipped during his ESPN appearance.</p><p class=p3>Swift began the international leg of her <i>Eras Tour </i>earlier this month, playing three shows in Argentina. Kelce was<a href=#> spotted in the VIP tent</a> — next to Taylor’s dad, <strong>Scott Swift</strong> — during her second show in Buenos Aires. She is currently performing<a href=#> a handful of shows in Brazil</a>. Overseas tour dates begin in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapmaSntqS3jKaYoaedmsButdKnq2acmajBs63CrZydZZKuerW%2BwK%2BgrGWbmrmksYydmK2hnpx6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
