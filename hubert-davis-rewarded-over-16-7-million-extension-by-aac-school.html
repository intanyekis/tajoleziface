The deal was signed in late August and made public Wednesday.</p><p>It will pay an average of nearly $2.8 million per year, starting with $2.3 million for the 2022-23 season and increasing to $3.1 million for the final year. Performance bonuses could add another nearly $1.1 million per season.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>Bronny James Reportedly Signed A New NIL Deal With Beats By Dre</b></a></span></p><p>According to <a href=#><i>Forbes</i></a>, Davis became the first African-American head coach in program history when he signed a five-year deal after succeeding retiring Hall of Fame coach Roy Williams in April 2021. It was worth about $10 million in base salary, supplemental pay, Learfield/Nike compensation and the expense allowance. It also featured a similar performance-bonus structure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Davis made $1.8 million last year before picking up another $575,000 in bonuses for the Final Four run, when he became the first coach to lead a team to the championship game in his first full season as head coach. He was originally due to make at least $2.9 million in 2025-26.</p><p>Davis, 52, played for North Carolina under late Hall of Famer Dean Smith and coached under Williams for nine seasons.</p><p>“I love this job,” Davis said during the Atlantic Coast Conference preseason media day earlier this month. “I’ve always wanted to be a part of this program. And to say that I’ve been able to be a part of it as a player, as an assistant coach and now as a head coach is a really cool deal.”</p><p>The Tar Heels are among the betting favorites — along with Gonzaga, Houston and Kentucky — to cut down the nets in Houston next April.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’m so happy that we have determined guys like R.J. [Davis] and Caleb [Love] and Leaky [Black] and Armando [Bacot],” he said in a recent interview. “It seems like no one factors in they really like it at Carolina. The experience that we had last year, none of them had ever experienced that before.</p><p>“And it makes me feel good that they wanted to come back to school, they wanted to see if we can get one more rebound. They wanted to experience the same things that we experienced last year and reach some of the goals that we missed last year, and so maybe I’m naive, but I really believe that the 14 of the 17 guys that returned from last year’s team, the reason being is because they want to be here.”</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b> Russell Westbrook’s Newly Purchased House In Brentwood, Los Angeles Costs $37 Million</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Forbes</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1tq7Eq6tmnJGrtrR50Z6umqqUmrFuu9WeqWZpZmKEbrnIpaOip55isrnAxKeqoqeeYq%2B6ecCammark528sLiO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
