Pedro has gone on to become a very successful real estate agent with some big name clients, as detailed on his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. Pedro’s sister, <strong>Nicole Jimeno</strong>, made a few appearances on the latter series and found her own fame as well. However, the real star of the family is finally getting her own chance to shine: their mother <strong>Lidia Morel</strong>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Pedro-Jimeno-Lidia-Jimeno-tlc-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Throughout Pedro’s time on the TLC network, Lidia popped up to add a dash of drama with her brash attitude. She would often get accused of trying to sabotage her adult children’s relationships in the process. Despite making it difficult for Pedro and Nicole to maintain a love life, the TLC fan-favorite decided to take her own chance at romance on the new spin-off <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>90 Day Fiance: Love In Paradise.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In a sneak peek at TLC’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>premiere episode,</a> Lidia introduces herself like a bona fide reality star. “People say that I have a strong personality, that I’m an evil woman and a meddler in my kids’ life,” Lidia began in her confessional. “But I think they don’t understand me.” Let’s try to understand Lidia a bit more, below.</p><h2>Where Is Lidia From?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>In 90 Day Fiancé: Love Is Paradise, Lidia reveals she is a 56-year-old lawyer who was born and raised in the Dominican Republic. She also shares a little bit about herself on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>, where she enjoys sharing selfies and her love for Barbie! Check it out <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>!</p><h2>Lidia Is Estranged From Pedro & Nicole’s Father</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Pedro and Nicole’s father has been absent from the 90 Day Fiancé franchise and now we know why. “The truth is I have been strong because my life has been difficult,” Lidia confessed on 90 Day Fiancé: Love In Paradise. “I was with Pedro and Nicole’s father for 15 years but I wasn’t the only woman in his life. I decided to end things with him and I had to take care of two kids by myself, I never saw him again.”</p><h2>What Happened Between Lidia & Her Daughter-In-Law Chantel?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Pedro and his wife&nbsp;<strong>Chantel </strong>appeared on season 4 of the popular TLC series&nbsp;90 Day Fiancé. The pair met while she was on vacation in his native Dominican Republic. Their relationship was rocky right off the bat, with both Lidia and Chantel’s parents highly disapproving of the match. It was train wreck after train wreck whenever any of in-laws were in the picture.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>As mentioned, Lidia and Chantel were pretty much at odds during the series. However, Chantel once made a surprise trip to the Dominican Republic to visit her mother-in-law to try to repair her marriage after Pedro asked to be separated. LIdia and Chantel bonded for a moment, with Chantel gifting Lidia Gucci earrings, but d<span class=ILfuVd lang=en><span class=hgKElc>espite all Chantel’s efforts to save the marriage, the couple filed for divorce on May 27, 2022.&nbsp;</span></span></p><h2>Why Is Lidia Looking For Love Now?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>While Lidia was navigating her children’s love life, she wasn’t looking to find one of her own. In the teaser, she admits that her last relationship was 12 years ago and she’s ready for a new adventure.</p><h2>Lidia Hopes Her New Boyfriend Is ‘Worthy’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-14>Lidia and <strong>Scott</strong>, a body builder and respiratory therapist, were dating online for a year before he flew to the Dominican Republic to meet her in person, which is where the show picks up their journey. “But with neither of them speaking the same language and Scott’s old Colombian flame trying to rekindle something, the couple has a lot to figure out during their vacation,” read TLC’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>It’s been a while since Lidia has dated, so it appears she doesn’t want to waste any time if it’s not a love match in the bedroom. “I hope Scott is worthy because I didn’t wait 12 years of my life for a tiny thing,” she coyly explained in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>teaser</a> trailer.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Fingers crossed, Lidia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K5qrDImmSmp6KauW6Fj2abmrFdm7aiusKeZG5oZ2qEeoOO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
