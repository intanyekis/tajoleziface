Rousey initially kept her love life private but later&nbsp;confirmed she was dating Browne.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t talk about my personal life much. That’s why it’s called ‘personal life.’ It’s true that Travis and I are in a relationship. I’ve really enjoyed the time we have spent together and getting to know one another. And that’s all I’m going to say about it,” Rousey told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ESPN</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>After almost two years of dating, they got engaged in April 2017 and married in August 2017 in Hawaii. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Ronda Rousey Opens up about Her Husband</h2><p>A year later, during her first anniversary, the <a href=# rel=follow>MMA fighter</a> appeared on&nbsp;Live with Kelly and Ryan&nbsp;and opened up about her husband.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Host <a href=# rel=follow>Ryan Seacrest</a> revealed that Rousey told the producer that Browne was “suspiciously perfect” and then asked Rousey to explain.&nbsp;</p><p>Rousey explained that “suspiciously perfect” meant her husband did things for her that “a real human actually would not.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I was filming while 22 in Bogota, and he flew all the way down to come and visit me, and he shows up, and he was like ‘you said nothing about it but I thought maybe you would forget and I brought you a box of tampons’” shared the fighter.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Ronda Rousey talking about her husband on Live with Kelly and Ryan.</strong> (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She also shared another lovely gesture the former UFC heavyweight did for her.&nbsp;</p><p>While calling Browne to ask how he was holding up without her, her husband said he had gotten her these cast-iron pans because Rousey loved them, but she was too busy to season them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So Browne ended up seasoning those pans for her, to which Rousey jokingly said it made her suspicious at how sweet her partner&nbsp;was.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>After getting married, Rousey took a break from WWE because she wanted to start a family.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ronda Rousey Welcomes a Baby Girl</h2><p>In April 2021, the couple confirmed they were <a href=# rel="follow noopener">pregnant</a> in a YouTube video titled ‘Ronda and Travis Have An Announcement!’&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Rousey revealed she had been pregnant since January, adding she could not hide her baby bump anymore, so it was time to show it off.&nbsp;</p><p>A few months later, the soon-to-be mother opened up about her pregnancy journey and her excitement to meet her daughter in an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram post</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“I wish I could say pregnancy feels amazing and that I’ve never felt more powerful as a woman. But it feels more like my organs are being crushed by the miracle of life. I’ve never felt more exhausted, unmotivated, or aware of gravity. Some days I have to lie on my side for hours just to breathe comfortably,” said the WWE star.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, Browne was there every step of the way, helping her. And then, on September 27, 2021, the couple finally met their daughter.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKqfo7GiedGorKydqWK1tr%2FBmqWdZpipuq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
