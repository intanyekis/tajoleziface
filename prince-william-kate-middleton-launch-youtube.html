Based on the teaser they released to the public, it seems their focus will be on sharing family moments and child-friendly content with their viewers, and their fans are all-in, eagerly anticipating the influx of Royal content that they crave.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Report Of "Prince Philip" Royal Yacht Leaves Buckingham Palace Displeased</a></span></p><p>It seems that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">something has shifted within the royal family</a>, and it is likely not a coincidence that it shifted shortly after the release of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's damning interview with Oprah Winfrey.</p><p>Immediately following the jaw-dropping revelations that resulted from that interview, the Royal family seemed to go into full damage-control mode and eagle-eyed Royal watchers quickly noticed a change in the way Kate Middleton presented herself to the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her social media became more personal, and much more fun. she increased interactions with her fans and began to smile more, wear more makeup, and look generally happier and more relaxed about sharing information with fans.</p><p>Perhaps not by coincidence, Middleton began to portray the Royal family as being less rigid and everything about her persona seemed more playful and delightfully happy than previous messaging would suggest. Many formalities remain but she seems more relaxed within them.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The introduction of this YouTube channel</a> is an extension of this newfound freedom of expression that Kate seems to have experienced as of late.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The teaser that the couple shared with the world is in itself a more casual, playful version of the Royal couple, as William starts it off by jokingly telling Kate that she had better be careful as the cameras were now rolling. As she laughs along at the fact that they were being recorded, it was immediately obvious to fans that this was just the beginning of many more fun videos to come.</p><p>The exact content to be featured within their new YouTube channel has not yet been revealed, but judging by their introduction it seems that Kate and William will bring the cameras along on some of their adventures and will be&nbsp;showing and sharing a more candid, behind the scenes perspective than they had previously shared in the past.</p><p>Even the camera angles for this teaser seemed different. Capturing the couple mid-conversation and having side-bar chats while filming them from behind and from a side angle outdoors, it's apparent that fans are now about to watch the Royal family appear on camera, rather than watching them pose and get poised for one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meghan Markle & Prince Harry Join Stars Raising Billions For COVID Vaccines</a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Twitter: KensingtonRoyal,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CTV</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS9s7XNnJxmr5mhuaqtzGaimqyVYrqqsMOlnK2nnmK5osHNnJ9msZ%2BqwbauxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
