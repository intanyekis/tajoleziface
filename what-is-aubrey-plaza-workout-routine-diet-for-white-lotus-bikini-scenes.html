Even though she was surrounded by lots of other amazing looking stars, Aubrey Plaza still managed to blow people away at The White Lotus' second season premiere.Similarly, when Plaza starred in the second season of The White Lotus, she was surrounded by many <a href=#>rich and famous stars</a>. Despite that, Plaza still stood out both for her stunning performance and how ripped she looked.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Survivor Influenced Mike White's Vision For The White Lotus</a></span>While it has always been obvious that Plaza is a beautiful woman, it wasn't until recently that people have been talking about how fit she looks. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, how did Plaza become so ripped?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-do-most-celebrities-get-so-fit>How Do Most Celebrities Get So Fit?</h2><p>Thanks to the fact that movie stars are often asked to play action stars or superheroes, it is common for famous actors to be in mind-blowing shape. As a result, it can be easy for observers to forget how much stars like Chris Hemsworth put in to be so ripped.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Unusual Way Brad Pitt Got In Shape For 'Fight Club'</a></span></p><p>In order for stars like Hugh Jackman or Angelina Jolie to have such incredible bodies, there are two things they do. First off, the stars strictly control what they eat and drink, and they then adopt difficult workout routines that are specially formulated to produce the gains they desire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hugh-jackman-leaving-the-gym.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While eating well and working out is obvious advice for anyone who wants to transform their body, every once in a while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stars do strange things to get in shape</a>.</p><p>Some more unique celebrity workout routines include Mel B's intimate sessions, Matthew McConaughey who drops and does push-ups randomly throughout the day, and Victoria Beckham who does face yoga. Then there is Kelly Osbourne who hula-hoops and Gwyneth Paltrow who somehow does yoga without gravity.</p><h2 id=how-did-aubrey-plaza-get-into-incredible-shape>How Did Aubrey Plaza Get Into Incredible Shape?</h2><p>Back when Parks and Recreation fans were first introduced to Aubrey Plaza, most of them must have assumed there was no way she is as sarcastic as her character April was. As it turns out, however, it could easily be argued that Plaza is far more sarcastic than her April ever was.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Aubrey Plaza Has A Theory Over Her Awkwardness With Stems From Her Past</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of how sarcastic Plaza often is, a lot of people don't know how to take her. In fact, it once was reported that <a href=#>her agent had to tell Plaza to tone it down around Robert De Niro</a> since the acting legend was struggling to handle her antics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/aubrey-plaza-dressed-like-a-witch-in-new-york-city.jpg><p>While many fans feel that Plaza has a delightful sense of humor, it can be hard to get her to answer questions seriously at times. For that reason, it likely won't surprise anyone that when it comes to Plaza's fitness routine, it is hard to know exactly what she does.</p><p>Unlike stars like <a href=#>Dwayne Johnson who love to reveal the details of their workout regime</a>, Plaza is cagey at best. However, even though it is impossible to detail how Plaza has sculpted her body, that doesn't mean that nothing is known about how she got so fit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The first thing to know about Plaza's workout regimen is that she has remarked in the past that she struggles to do the same exercises on any kind of ongoing basis. As a result, it seems safe to assume that she mixes things up.</p><p>More importantly, when Plaza was interviewed by The Cut, she explained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what being healthy means to her</a>. "Wellness, to me, is: Being conscious of what you’re putting into your body and on your body, and taking care of yourself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of that belief, Plaza has revealed that one of the ways she stays healthy is by consuming a great deal of tea and water. During that same interview with The Cut, Plaza detailed how she likes to work out when she isn't in the gym.</p><p>According to Plaza, she was a big fan of staying fit by playing basketball and practicing yoga. "I love yoga — that’s probably my favorite exercise because I’m not so much into cardio."</p><p>Another one of the ways that Plaza stays healthy is by taking her dogs for walks. In fact, Plaza stays active walking her dogs so often that she has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joked about how many photos the paparazzi have of her dogs</a>, including pictures of her picking up after the animals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecCumaudqWK9ra3ZmmSwp6KgvLbAjKumrqyZo7JusMieq2aen6d6uLTIrZxmpJ%2BpwrR5waKioqaZYsCksc2eqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
