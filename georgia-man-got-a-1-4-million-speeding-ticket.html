Georgia-based news outlet WJBF reported that Cato was certain "he was going to get a super speeder ticket" for allegedly going <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">90 miles per hour (MPH) in a 55 mile per hour</a> zone when the traffic stop occurred.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Untitled-design-2021-03-17T140243.631.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>4 Most Expensive Traffic Tickets Ever Written</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Expensive traffic tickets are a fact of life for many, but these fines and infractions made headlines across the world.</span><p>WJBF mentioned a "super speeder ticket" in relation to the $1.4 million speeding fine in question. According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia.gov page about "super speeder" tickets</a>, the label describes additional penalties for speeds far in excess of the speed limit in a given zone:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Super Speeders are drivers ticketed for traveling 75 mph or faster on a 2-lane road or 85 mph or faster on other roads or highways. Any Georgia residents or out-of-state drivers convicted of the speeding offense will receive a notification in the mail ... If drivers do not pay the Super Speeder fee within 120 days, the driver’s license will be suspended."</p><p>Text at the top of the page indicated that a "Super Speeder fine is an extra $200 added to speeding tickets." No mention of fines in excess of $200 appeared on the page, nor did it mention any six figure versions of speeding tickets.</p><p>According to WJBF, Cato called the city of Savannah to verify the fine. Cato said of the call:</p><p>"'$1.4 million,' the lady told me on the phone. I said, ‘This might be a typo’ and she said, ‘No sir, you either pay the amount on the ticket or you come to court on Dec. 21 [2023] at 1:30 p.m.'”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jason-sudeikis-and-olivia-wilde-face-millions-in-legal-bills-as-ex-nanny-demands-jury-trial.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Jason Sudeikis And Olivia Wilde Face Huge Legal Bills As Ex-Nanny Demands Jury Trial</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Even if Jason and Olivia are forced to pay their ex-employee damages, they could be left with huge legal bills from the months-long lawsuit.</span><p>Savannah, Georgia's WSAV covered the $1.4 million speeding ticket on October 12th, bringing the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unusual incident to a wider audience</a>. Sneh Patel (Cato's attorney) indicated that fines for misdemeanors have a $1,000 cap, and Patel said of the ticket:</p><p>"At first when I was asked about this, I thought it was a clerical error [...] apparently it’s not a clerical error. But again, I have never seen something like this, ever.”</p><p>Patel continued, describing a slightly higher cap of $5,000 for misdemeanors of a "high and aggravated nature." Cato's attorney said misdemeanors of a particularly severe nature might warrant higher bond, but Patel was unable to explain how any elements of Georgia law could add up to a $1.4 million fine for speeding:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“ ... the bond amount should be relevant to [the severity of the alleged infraction,] so for [a] misdemeanor, you wouldn’t see bond amounts over $5,000[,] maybe $10,000[,] just to ensure if it’s a crime that involves violence or if you’re anticipating they will commit more crimes, [the court] would set a higher amount or if you think they won’t show for court, you set a higher amount ... But not $1.4 million — that’s something that [typically involves] cases that are [related to] drug trafficking, murders or aggravated assaults, something of that nature.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sackler-bankruptcy.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Sackler Saga: Purdue Pharma, Opioids, And The $6 Billion Dilemma</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Can a $6 billion bankruptcy settlement cleanse Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers of their transgressions and give them a clean slate?</span><p>WSAV asked the city of Savannah to explain Cato's six figure speeding ticket. In an update to the article, the outlet quoted the city as saying that a "placeholder" fine of just under $1 million is applied to ensure anyone ticketed as a "super speeder" prioritizes their court date to resolve the ticket:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The balance reflected in the e-citation is a placeholder. Super speeders are required to go to court. The system automatically puts in $999,999.99 as the base amount plus other costs since the only way [for Connor Cato] to resolve the ticket is to appear in court."</p><p>In another section, the city affirmed that the $1.4 million fine is not "enforced," and noted that the "placeholder" sum has been in use since 2017:</p><p>"The balance reflected in the e-citation is a placeholder, not a fine. The amount is not enforced. This has been in practice since 2017 when a new system was put into place."</p><p>Finally, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press covered Connor Cato</a>'s $1.4 million speeding ticket in an October 15th article. In that reporting, Savannah city spokesperson Joshua Peacock asserted the city doesn't "issue that placeholder as a threat to scare anybody into court, even if this person heard differently from somebody in our organization," and that the fine itself could not exceed $1,000 (plus court costs).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoJ2fp7SqrYymmKdll6TBbq2MamRtZZ2eua21zqdkrKiVmrGqusZmq6Kbm5rBcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
