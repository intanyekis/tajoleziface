Quickly after the seemingly fast friendship formed, fans tracked down old tweets Brittany had made about the singer, and they weren't flattering.</p><p>The tweets were, as readers can see, very mean, but in some of them, Brittany Mahomes was only 18, so it's completely possible that she has since changed her mind.</p><p>It's not just the tweets that angered swifties, though. Recently, Brittany collaborated with Kim Kardashian, and sources have called her out for being disloyal to Taylor Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It truly showed how loyal she is to her friends. <strong>And Brittany chose money over friendship</strong>, which says a lot," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told the Daily Mail</a>. The insider described her collaboration with Kim Kardashian's brand SKIMS as a "betrayal," and claimed that Brittany is only "acting like Taylor's BFF" because she "is desperate to be known" as more than "a trophy wife to an NFL star."</p><p>"<strong>She has tried so hard to insert herself into Swift's circle</strong>. She has wanted to be relevant for so long and finally found her in," another source added. "<strong>She has too many red flags and people are starting to see through her fake and b**chy persona. She is an opportunist who is clearly not a girl's girl.</strong>"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6Gkqa6vxYymmKGnnZrAbrLLmqynrKNivaa%2BxZ6arWWWlrqquNhmmZqbm6GutLSMnKampZWjwbR505qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
