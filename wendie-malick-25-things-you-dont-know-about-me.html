Read on to learn more about the Hot in Cleveland alum and The Owl House star.</p><p>1. I love organic raw cashews. I eat a lot of them … I mean, a lot.</p><p>2. My first television appearance was on Romper Room with Frizzy, our pet alligator.</p><p>3. My family gave me the nickname “Weed” when I was 11 because I shot up like a weed that summer.</p><p>4. I’ve been a pescatarian for 32 years.</p><p>5. I’m one-quarter Egyptian.</p><p>6. My first job was modeling for AM&A’s department store. I was convinced I “invented” the low ponytail: fastened at the nape of the neck with a bow — kind of like our Founding Fathers.</p><p>7. I didn’t start riding horses until I was 40. We now have four and one miniature donkey.</p><p>8. My hidden talents: I can stand on my head in a cocktail dress, raise one eyebrow at a time and whistle like a sailor.</p><p>9. If I weren’t an actress, I would’ve been a veterinarian.</p><p>10. Best advice I ever got was from author <strong>Elizabeth Gilbert</strong>: “Just try to be the love in the room.”</p><p>11. I worked in Washington, D.C., as an intern for Buffalo Congressman Jack Kemp in 1972, during the Watergate scandal. Very interesting.</p><p>12. Most of my best friends have been dogs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Wendie-Malick-25-Things-You-Dont-Know-About-Me-01.jpg><p>13. I’m still close with my Just Shoot Me! peeps. We had dinner a few weeks ago, and it was like we never left.</p><p>14. My first car was a yellow 1965 MGB convertible. I bought it for $375. I loved it even though the seats had to be propped up with tires and it was missing first gear.</p><p>15. Michael O’Donoghue [<a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>’s first head writer] once told me: “You can take the girl out of Buffalo, but you can’t take the Buffalo out of the girl.” And I’m glad.</p><p>16. Trees are my church.</p><p>17. I murdered three husbands on three different shows during one television season in the ’80s.</p><p>18. Then I was cast in HBO’s Dream On, and they discovered I was funny. I loved every minute of it.</p><p>19. When I was in Brazil, I hang glided from a cliff in Rio. I felt like a red-tailed hawk. It was mind-blowing.</p><p>20. I listen to R&B really loud in my car and sing at the top of my lungs.</p><p>21. My favorite cocktail is a very cold gin martini with just a whisper of vermouth.</p><p>22. I can grill salmon, cook a yummy “poor man’s soup” and make a mean salad.</p><p>23. If I could have dinner with anyone, dead or alive, it would be Rosalind Russell, one of my all-time favorite actresses.</p><p>24. In my 20s, I parachuted out of a small Cessna because I was afraid of heights. I didn’t overcome that but I didn’t die from it, and I’m glad I did it.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>25. The summer after I met my husband, we rode motorcycles in Africa. I crashed mine several times before breaking my ankle.</p><p>The Owl House airs on Disney Channel, Fridays at 8:45 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawnZ6ZtqZ5zJqjopubYn92edOhoKefo2LGsMGMnaanrF2gu7DDjJqZqK2kYrqmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
