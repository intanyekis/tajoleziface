However, she didn’t share why she was cut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/There-Was-a-Kelsea-Ballerini-and-Jonas-Brothers-Collab-3.jpg><p><a href=#><strong>Kevin</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Joe</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Nick Jonas</strong></a> released “Strong Enough” with Zimmerman, 23, on November 10. “We’re so excited to team up with Bailey for ‘Strong Enough’!” the brothers said in a press release at the time. “He’s such a talented artist who’s had an amazing year, so it’s been a blast collaborating with him.”</p><p>Zimmerman gushed over working alongside the siblings, adding, “I’ve been a fan of the Jonas Brothers for as long as I can remember. I literally grew up with them! It’s been incredible to get to know Joe, Nick, and Kevin, and we’ve already shared some memories I’ll never forget. The fact that they would ask me to be on a song still blows my mind. I hope y’all like it as much as I do!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/There-Was-a-Kelsea-Ballerini-and-Jonas-Brothers-Collab-4.jpg><p>Following the single’s success, the Jonas Brothers <a href=# rel=noopener>announced via Instagram</a> on Friday that they will be taking the stage with Zimmerman on Saturday, November 18, in Harrisonburg, Virginia, as part of the pregame entertainment for the James Madison Dukes and Appalachian State Mountaineers matchup.</p><p>“Thank you for all the love on ‘Strong Enough’ this past week! Excited to perform it for the first time with @bailey.zimmerman tomorrow at @collegegameday 🔥,” the band teased.</p><p>Ballerini, meanwhile, has been keeping herself equally as busy this month after playing a sold-out show in her hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee, on November 2.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I saw my first concert ever in this arena when I was a kid … and then 15,000 of you showed up so it could be the place where I played my first ever headline arena show,” the “Half of My Hometown” singer <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote via Instagram</a> after the performance. “I wish I could go back and show little me the photos, but honestly glad she had no clue.”</p><p>Ballerini followed up the gig by playing a heartfelt rendition of “Leave Me Again” at the <a href=#>2023 CMA Awards</a> in Nashville.
