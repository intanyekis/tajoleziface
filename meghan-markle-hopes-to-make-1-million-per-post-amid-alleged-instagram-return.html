Anticipate an imminent announcement. She's making a return," a source informed <a href=#>Daily Mail,</a> strongly suggesting that Meghan is indeed the person behind the single-name account.</p><p>“Everyone in Hollywood is talking about the re-launch being imminent,” they went on. “Meghan has never made any secret of the fact she wants to return to Instagram.”</p><p>Meghan's reentry into social media doesn't come as a surprise, given her allusion to the prospect last year. In an interview with The Cut, she hinted, "Do you want to know a secret? I'm getting back on Instagram," although she refrained from disclosing further particulars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meghan's comeback to Instagram coincides with reports suggesting a downturn in her career. Notably, Instagram has recently revealed the termination of their million-dollar contract, and there are rumblings that Netflix might follow suit unless <a href=#>Meghan and Harry deliver content with more substantial performance</a>.</p><p>The reported decline in their careers seems to have had an impact on the <a href=#>couple's financial situation, thereby exerting strain</a> on their marriage. For months, they've been navigating rumors of potential divorce, with one source even suggesting that <a href=#>Harry and Meghan have hired divorce attorneys</a>.</p><p>There's also conjecture that Meghan's resurgence on social media might be tied to financial motivations. Certain estimates indicate that she could potentially earn around $1 million per sponsored post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You have celebrities such as the Kardashians who can demand $1 million (£790,000) or more for a single post endorsing a product," <a href=#>remarked Eric Schiffer,</a> a social media expert and consultant, when discussing Meghan's potential earnings on Instagram.</p><p>Schiffer further affirmed, "There's absolutely no rationale why Meghan couldn't be securing fees of that magnitude."</p><p>Currently, Meghan has refrained from directly addressing the rumors regarding her Instagram comeback. Nevertheless, the chatter has generated favorable attention for the actress, possibly aligning with her aim to sustain relevance in the realm of Hollywood.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kim Zolciak & Daughter Brielle Sued Over Massive Unpaid Credit Card Bills</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>, <a href=#>Independent</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6prPHmqVmpZGnuK2xjKGmqZ2jYsGwecyaop5lYWK6qrjLoqanZaCav268zqyrZpmdnrFurculnKCdlGK2r7%2FTmp6rmZ1iv6bA1KulaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
