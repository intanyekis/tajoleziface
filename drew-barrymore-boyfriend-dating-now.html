She and her ex-husband are now in a good place. Still, the Honest Beauty founder <a href=#>admits she sometimes struggles to co-parent to the best of her abilities.</a> Since healing from her divorce, Drew has been busy building up other parts of her life. So much so that finding love again has been put on the back burner indefinitely. Will the actress find a way to open her heart up to love again, and better yet, is she even interested in it?</p><h2 id=drew-barrymore-says-she-doesn-39-t-know-how-to-date-anymore>Drew Barrymore Says She Doesn't Know How To Date Anymore</h2><p>Drew has <a href=#>gotten candid about her struggles in the love department numerous times</a>. During a conversation with Queer Eye's Bobby Burke in 2022, she tearfully explained what she thinks were some reasons she hasn't dated since the divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For one, she feels she doesn't know how to date in this new world. It's been over ten years since Drew was in the dating world, and the actress doesn't know where to begin.</p><p>Online dating was something people only dreamed of the last time Drew was looking for a boyfriend, and now it's the predominant way couples meet. The two joked about online dating and how Zoom dates could make it easier to back out of date gone wrong, but nothing seemed to ease Drew's worries about the current dating scene.</p><p>Bobby and his Queer Eye co-star Antoni tried to help Drew get back into the dating scene by setting her up with a friend via Instagram. While it helped Drew get her feet wet, she didn't end up going further than the first date with her Top Chef love match.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drew-39-s-daughters-are-her-true-loves>Drew's Daughters Are Her True Loves</h2><p>After the rubble from her divorce settled, Drew realized another obstacle was blocking her from enjoying a carefree dating life - or two, ratherâ€”those being her daughters Olive and Frankie.</p><p>The girls are still young, only 10 and 8, and to say Drew is protective of them is an understatement. She rues the day that <a href=#>the two girls find out their mother had quite a wild side as a child herself</a>.</p><p>One of the underlying reasons Drew's divorce destroyed her was it left her feeling that this family she had built with her husband was being destroyed. She thought about her childhood, how her parents divorced when she was nine, and was horrified at the thought of her daughters feeling any of the things or ways she did as a child of divorce herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a conversation on Good Morning America this year, Drew bravely said that her daughters are very much the reason she isn't interested in dating. While her ex-husband has moved on, marrying Vogue's director of fashion initiatives Alexandra Michler in 2021, Drew isn't there yet.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything You Forgot About Drew Barrymore's Troubled Past</a></span></p><p>Drew emphasized that it would take her a long time to trust someone enough to introduce them to her girls. On the rare occasion that she goes on a date, she refuses to talk about her daughters. "I'm so protective of them that it makes me feel vulnerable to discuss them," explained the actress, "I have to know you a little bit better and have some trust."</p><p>It may just be that Drew's next boyfriend will have to wait for her daughters to be out of the house. She has said that the perfect time for her next relationship might be when her girls head off to college.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=even-if-she-finds-love-drew-never-wants-to-get-married-again>Even If She Finds Love, Drew Never Wants To Get Married Again</h2><p>There is one thing Drew is looking for in her next relationship, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">someone who has no interest in getting married</a>. After three divorces of her own, Drew has come to think of marriage as an outdated concept. While she still firmly believes in love, she doesn't think marriage is needed to solidify its bounds.</p><p>"I love that we are trying to hold on to an institution that started when the closest person to you for companionship was a three-day horse ride away, and your life span was 30 years," the actress said during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon Looks Back On How His Friendship With Drew Barrymore Started</a></span></p><p>It's an interesting angle coming from someone who only has positive relationships with her exes. Her talk show, The Drew Barrymore Show, has hosted numerous conversations between her and her ex-partners. One of the more memorable appearances was her ex-husband Tom Greene. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The pair reunited for the first time in 15 years on the talk show</a> in September 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The conversation was full of endearing moments between the two, with Tom even saying his parents were happy for Drew and her life. Drew touched upon feeling safe and content for one of the first times in her life during her relationship with Tom, thanking him for allowing her to see she could find that in the world. The conversation showed the maturity that can be reached between two people who share so much history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibq52nYq%2BivtGypKiqlWKvsMXFq6CeppRisaLAyKeeZqafrHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
