They made a hard impact,” he explained. “I told you how I feel about who is the best groups and all that kind of s**t. But Rest In Peace to that brother. So sad, man. Every time I seen him, he was just cool as hell. You know what I mean? I don’t know too much, but he was just cool, word. Laidback.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-955743666.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 46-year-old also spoke about the violence that often occurs at illegal dice games and how it often results in assaults, shootings, and other confrontations. “Them s**ts are dangerous, bro,” Louch told Vlad.” I do know of a few people that got killed at dice games.
