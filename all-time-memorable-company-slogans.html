A slogan is often used to represent what the brand stands for and <a href=#>how it serves its consumers.</a> Thus, it has to be precise to leave a lasting impression in the viewer’s mind. At the same time, it also has to be justifiably descriptive for it to capture <a href=#>the essence of the brand.</a></p><p>As complicated as it sounds, choosing or creating a slogan for a company is not the easiest of tasks. It is, however, a successful endeavor if the message is clearly conveyed to a potential consumer. This is also how a brand can hope to create a favorable first impression. A good slogan must be simple and easy to remember while also being catchy and unique. It is believed that a good slogan has the power to increase the sales revenue by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">30 percent</a>.</p><p>Many well-known brands have passed this test and have become insanely famous, and here are some of the most memorable company slogans of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=m-amp-m-s-melts-in-your-mouth-not-in-your-hand>M&M’s “Melts in your mouth, not in your hand.''</h2><p>M&M’s is most accurate to its slogan that goes “Melts in your mouth, not in your hand.'' Today with <a href=#>several chocolate brands</a>, it has become increasingly difficult for a brand to stand out unless, of course, that brand adds an X-factor to it, which makes it a premium choice for consumers.</p><p>M&M’s soon figured out what that wow factor would be in the case of their candies. Consumers wanted the good chocolate to melt in their mouths. M&M’s picked this up and made their dream come true. Another feature to remind the consumer that they get the best from this brand is the alphabet ‘M’ on every candy. This slogan was created in 1954, and in 2014 it became <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the favorite slogan</a> in America.</p><h2 id=nike-just-do-it>Nike "Just Do It"</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nike’s iconic slogan “Just Do It” has a happening story behind it. It was created by Dan Wieden, the ad executive of Nike, back in 1988. He got inspired by the last words of the prisoner Gary Gilmore who said “Let’s do it,” and Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No" campaign.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's How Nike Became A Billion Dollar Company</a></span></p><p>The result was what became an inspirational slogan for every Nike consumer. It also resonates with the kind of sportsman <a href=#>spirit that Nike products carry</a> while creating the best sportswear for all sections of society.</p><h2 id=coca-cola-taste-the-feeling>Coca Cola "Taste The Feeling"</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coca-Cola perhaps has one of the smartest approaches to creating a slogan for itself. It has had several taglines, but the one which won the game and the hearts of consumers was “Open Happiness.”</p><p>This idea of equating a drink with happiness was ingenious and had been working well with the buyers. It also resonates well with the youth culture of getting a can or a bottle of the drink from a nearby vending machine and opening it to taste ultimate happiness. It also received a humongous 50 million likes on Facebook before the company renovated its slogan to “<a href=#>Taste The Feeling</a>,” which was another genius attempt at taking the emotional approach.</p><h2 id=apple-think-different>Apple “Think Different”</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apple’s slogan is plain and simple - “Think Different” - and yet it manages to capture the essence of improvisation in the field of unique tech for which the company aspires with every new creation. The new Apple smart car, for example, is giving <a href=#>tough competition</a> to Elon Musk’s innovative vehicle.</p><p>In 1997, Steve Jobs came up with his brilliant slogan that impressed most of the audience for his presentation at Macworld. With years of expansion in business, Apple’s taglines have been improvised but “Think different” still remains the most memorable as it also increased the company’s stock price <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">by three times</a>.</p><h2 id=levi-s-quality-never-goes-out-of-style>Levi’s “Quality never goes out of style.”</h2><p>Be it a fashion expert or a layman, and nobody could argue with the statement, “Quality never goes out of style.” Thus, the slogan of Levi’s might sound quite simple, but it has a deeper truth hidden in it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With new fashion brands making their debut every day in the market, each tries hard to stand out in the crowd. Consumers are known for their eccentricity, but something that never falls out of trend is the quality of a product. The creators of Levi’s have known that they can hold their customers by offering something no other brand can compete with - the premium quality of a Levi’s.</p><h2 id=kfc-finger-licking-good>KFC "Finger Licking Good"</h2><p>As a food joint with branches all over the globe, <a href=#>the story of how KFC came into being</a> is epic itself, by the time KFC became famous at an international level, it was also synonymous with its creator Harland Sanders.</p><p>Sanders would appear in KFC ads eating the chicken wings and licking his fingers. When a woman pointed that out to a TV station as something fascinating, a spontaneous reply was received from an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arizona franchise</a> saying, “Well, it’s finger lickin’ good.” At that very point, KFC knew what its slogan would be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=l-or-al-because-i-m-worth-it>L'Oréal "Because I'm Worth It"</h2><p>L'Oréal's slogan, "Because I'm Worth It", is not just rant in the air. It has a layered history of feminist campaigns to back it up as a genuine tagline for women's empowerment. The slogan became public when Joanne Dusseau said it for the first time in a TV commercial for the brand.</p><p>Ilon Specht, a copywriter at a marketing agency called Third Avenue was the brain behind the tagline. In 2012, a documentary film was released about the history of the slogan. From its past campaigns, it is clear that the French personal care company takes its slogan-making job pretty seriously.</p><h2 id=disneyland-the-happiest-place-on-earth>Disneyland “The Happiest Place On Earth''</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Disneyland is more than an amusement park, but it has been the subject of various studies about the work-leisure equation. This clarifies the fact that <a href=#>Disneyland is not age-specific</a>. It is a getaway for adults as much as it is for children. More importantly, Disneyland is not just a franchise or a place; it is an emotion, and for grown-ups, that emotion is nostalgia.</p><p>The slogan “The Happiest Place On Earth'' works perfectly to represent all of the values that Disney stands for. It also goes hand in hand with the narrative of most Disney fairy tales - the one with a ‘happily-ever-after’.</p><p>It might seem absurd at times to see companies spend millions to get the right slogan for themselves. However, for the value that a slogan brings to the brand is truly worth the money spent. Interestingly, in the case of a lot of memorable slogans, the find has also been accidental.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Most Expensive Logos In The World</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">B12</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quality Logo Products</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HubSpot</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Spark</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSurbiMraCmnV2isq670ZqZpZ1dmLyuvMCnsGarnKS0orrSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
