There have been several interviews where the rapper has been asked about his sexual orientation.</p><p>But Carti has never explicitly answered the question.&nbsp;His&nbsp;most recent interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">XXL</a> has piqued people's curiosity since, once again, Carti is being subtle about his sexuality. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As a result, they have taken to Instagram and Twitter to discuss Carti.</p><h2>What Is Playboi Carti's Sexuality?</h2><p>To date, Carti has not been linked with any men.
