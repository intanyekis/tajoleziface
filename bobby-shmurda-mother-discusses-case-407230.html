This counts as the latest setback in the Brooklyn rapper’s case involving his GS9 squad. Just a month before that, Shmurda was denied bail for the seventh time, as a judge also refused to lower its whopping $2 million total. His mother Leslie Pollard – whose other son, Javase “Fame” Pollard was also arrested along with Bobby – sat down with <a href=# rel=nofollow>REVOLT</a> to discuss the handling of her son’s case.</p><p>“It’s something very personal against my son, and when I go in the courtroom, I can see it’s something very personal against him,” she said. “When we go up for the appeals for the bail, of we go up to request the bail, it is something very personal going on in the courtroom. What it is? I don’t know. But the only thing I can do is pray it off.”</p><p>Speaking on the difficulty of witnessing her son’s plight, Pollard shared that he relies on her faith in God. She also noted that this was Bobby’s first time being away from her for this long. He was arrested in December 2014, and currently faces charges for conspiracy, reckless endangerment, criminal possession of a weapon and criminally using drug paraphernalia. Pollard discussed the portrayal of her son by authorities.</p><p>“No matter what person they try to portray Ackquille [Bobby Shmurda] to be… they try to make him out to be a monster, but anybody that knows him knows it’s just not that,” she said.</p><p>As far as how her son is faring with the unfortunate situation, his mother said he is having trouble figuring out who his allies are.</p><p>“To be treated so unfairly by someone that can control your destiny, that’s hard. He doesn’t know what to do, he doesn’t know what to think, he doesn’t know who to trust.”</p><p>Watch Leslie Pollard discuss Bobby Shmurda’s case below:</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://revolt.tv/embed/real-talk-leslie-pollard-real-bobby-shmurda-keeping-hope-alive-288bb987</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5e8o67YZqqhpaWnsaJ5zKiroZ2iYrGqv8Kuqqydo2Kwor%2FEZmtpb2JofXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
