She also enthused&nbsp;they cannot wait to meet them.&nbsp;</p><h2>A Look Into Nick’s Children</h2><p>Nick Cannon definitely has his hands full as a father.&nbsp;In 2008, the Wild ‘n Out&nbsp;star <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tied</a> the knot with Mariah Carey&nbsp;in the Bahamas.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>On their third wedding anniversary, the couple&nbsp;welcomed their fraternal twin&nbsp;son Moroccan and daughter Monroe&nbsp;Scott which Cannon confirmed in a tweet.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, the pair called it quits following which Cannon&nbsp;got into a relationship with Brittany Bell, a former NBA dancer for the Phoenix Suns, model, and pageant titleholder. The two were reportedly dating&nbsp;sometime around 2015, just a year before Nick’s divorce from Carey<strong>&nbsp;</strong>was finalized. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 2017, the Cannon and Bell couple welcomed their first child, a son&nbsp;named Golden “Sagon” Cannon. In a sit-down with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Power 106 hosts J Cruz and Krystal Bee</a>, Cannon opened up about his family.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>&nbsp;I’ve always wanted five kids. Just because my marriage was over didn’t mean I couldn’t continue my family.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>And Cannon kept true to his words when he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">had</a> his fourth child, a daughter&nbsp;with Bell,&nbsp;in 2020. The former Miss Arizona USA said their daughter was the best gift ever in a festive&nbsp;Instagram <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> on December 26, 2020. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The duo was in an on-and-off relationship from the very beginning. Although it is not clear when the pair split up, Cannon was seeing Jessica White when he welcomed his daughter. Cannon and White&nbsp;subsequently split following the news.</p><p>Nick was also&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">romantically linked to&nbsp;Lanisha Cole</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;February. But now, the Masked Singer host is ready to be a father again with Rosa and the twins.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cannon Does Not Believe in Monogamy</h2><p>The&nbsp;America’s Got Talent host wears many hats as a producer, rapper, host, actor, but fans seem to love keeping up with his relationships.&nbsp;He’s&nbsp;been linked to several notable women over the years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On his own radio show&nbsp;Nick Cannon Mornings, he got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">candid</a> about his relationship with&nbsp;reality star Evelyn Lozada. He revealed he could not&nbsp;subscribe to the idea of monogamy because men rarely had it in their DNA. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It’s that hunting mentality, but it’s also like ‘yo if we suppose to be fruitful and multiply…. there’s not many creatures on earth that are monogamous.</p><p>Cannon confessed he loves the romantic&nbsp;and whimsical facet of love, but once a woman wants to live together, he gets anxious.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGianqSVl8BwusicomabkaO7sLqMnZidZZaWuqq42GarsKGeqHqirsGyZaGsnaE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
