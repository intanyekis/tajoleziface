They continued to be <a href=#>hot and heavy through the summer</a>, often spending weekends and holidays together on the East End of Long Island.</p><p>That December, the couple made their <a href=#>first public appearance together</a> at the American Museum of Natural History Gala in New York City. They also <a href=#>debuted their relationship on TV</a> that month when they held hands while ice-skating at Rockefeller Center on a holiday-themed episode of SNL.</p><p>Jost supported Johansson at the Los Angeles premiere of her movie Avengers: Infinity War in April 2018, marking their <a href=#>first official red carpet appearance</a> as a pair. The next month, he <a href=#>called Johansson his “girlfriend”</a> during a “Weekend Update” segment on SNL.</p><p>The low-key couple continued to hit red carpets together through the end of 2018, <a href=#>attending the Met Gala</a> in May <a href=#>and the Emmys</a> in September. By February 2019, Us Weekly broke the news that the duo had <a href=#>moved in together</a>.</p><p>“Colin is still head over heels for Scarlett,” a source told Us at the time. “He thinks she is incredible, kind, beautiful. He is beyond doting to her and loves showing her off when they’re out. Scarlett loves Colin too, and they are in it for the long haul. … Colin gets a starry-eyed look in his eyes when he talks about her.”</p><p>Johansson and Jost <a href=#>revealed their engagement</a> in May 2019 after two years of dating. By October 2020, it was announced that <a href=#>the twosome had quietly tied the knot</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic while surrounded by immediate family and loved ones.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>This is Jost’s first marriage. Meanwhile, Johansson&nbsp;was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a> from 2008 to 2011 and <strong>Romain Dauriac</strong> from 2014 to 2017. She and the French journalist share daughter Rose. Jost and Johansson, for their part, welcomed their first child, son Cosmo, in summer 2021.</p><p>Scroll down to see a timeline of ScarJost’s relationship:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKSt0aWcraxdn7yprc2sqqimXZa7pXnCqKOipl2fvLTA0mapnqSRqbawutKhoKllpJ66prjIp5xo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
