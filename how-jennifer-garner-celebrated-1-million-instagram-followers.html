I’m uncomfortable and I’m also unhappy,” the <i>Miracles from Heaven </i>actress, 45, said as she winced while fidgeting with the dental shield. Although she tried to laugh through the pain, her endeavors were unsuccessful. “I’m unhappy. I’m unhappy in my heart.”</p><p class=p1>Garner took to the caption to explain the reasoning behind the mouthguard, which athletes typically use to protect their gums and teeth from injury. “When one shoots a cage fight, one must have a mouthguard,” the actress wrote alongside silly hashtags thanking fans for their support. “#momproblems #2minutestomold #PEPPERMINTmovie #onemillionfollowers #thankyousomuchforfollowing #thisiswhatyouregettinginto.”</p><p class=p1>The<i>13 Going on 30 </i>star<a href=#> joined the social networking platform in September 2017</a>. Garner acquired more than 120,000 nearly two hours after creating her account. She has since been very active on the app, using it as a forum to raise awareness for social advocacy organizations and share <a href=#>funny throwbacks</a> from her career.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Most recently, the <i>Love, Simon </i>actress<a href=#> used Instagram to sell Girl Scout cookies</a> outside of an L.A. grocery story on Sunday, February 11. Garner, mom to Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 5, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a>, waved around a colorful, homemade poster that read, “GS Cookies for Sale!”</p><p class=p1>Garner announced in a series of <a href=#>Instagram</a> Stories later that day that her followers could too order the delectable treats. “Good afternoon, I am so distressed to find out that some people don’t have access to a Girl Scout or Girl Scout cookies,” she said. “And while my Girl Scout and Brownie have to sell their own cookies, I did buy a limited number of boxes from them to share with you guys.”</p><p class=p1>“So if you truly have no Girl Scout in your life, please send me your order and your address and I will hook you up,” she promised. “Because what would this time of year be like without Thin Mints, Samoas and now there are gluten-free Savannah Smiles and the newest ones are Girl Scout S’mores.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6dit6a6zaKdnqpdnK6zusSrZJydnJqvs63TnptmaV2itq24yKilZqGeqMGis9GapGaen6G5sMPEq6po</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
