Will Wood masterfully weaves together poignant lyrics and atmospheric melodies to create a vivid and thought-provoking piece.</p><p>The song opens with a reflection on the natural cycle of life and death, where the destruction caused by wildfires serves as a catalyst for new growth. It speaks to the interconnectedness of life, even in moments of devastation. The reference to “salt deposits on warm little rivers” represents the residue left behind by emotional and past experiences, weighing us down.</p><p>In the chorus, the narrator expresses the feeling of losing too much, whether it be in relationships or personal endeavors. There is a sense of longing and recognizing the imbalance where one constantly takes more than gives. The imagery of “cicada days” suggests a fleeting period of connection and closeness that fades away too quickly.</p><p>The second verse builds upon the theme of loss and endangered connections. The mention of “glow-in-the-dark” ceiling stars and “purple waves of ancient chemicals” evokes a sense of nostalgia and longing for a time when things were simpler. However, there is an acknowledgment that burying these feelings may be the only way to move forward.</p><p>The pre-chorus highlights the conflicting advice received from different sources, emphasizing the complexity of navigating through difficult situations. It reflects the internal struggle of figuring out the best course of action when faced with pain and uncertainty.</p><p>The final chorus takes a shift, urging the red flags to fade away, suggesting a willingness to surrender and let go. However, there is also a recognition of the consequences of these actions, wondering what has been sacrificed in the pursuit of dreams. The outro serves as a reminder that personal growth and healing require active participation and a commitment to oneself.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span>Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>“Cicada Days – Live at Knitting Factory, Spokane, WA” is a profound and introspective song that explores the depths of loss, sacrifice, and personal growth.
