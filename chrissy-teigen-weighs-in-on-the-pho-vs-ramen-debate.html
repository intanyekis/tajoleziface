The star weighed in on the pho versus ramen debate after rapper <strong>Wale</strong> kicked things off by asking Twitter to choose between the two similar dishes. “Pho or ramen? Let’s argue,” he declared.</p><p>The 33-year-old responded quickly, indicating she needed more information from the musician, whose real name is Olubowale Victor Akintimehin, before revealing her verdict. “Wale, this is very hard. I need more details,” she tweeted in response. “Are you hungover? Lunch, dinner? Are we comparing the best pho to the best ramen?”</p><p>Then, seemingly indicating which noodle soup dish she might choose over the other, Teigen added: “I LOVE pho but I feel like bad pho is worse than bad ramen.”</p><p>Pho (pronounced “fuh”) is a Vietnamese soup consisting of broth, rice noodles called bánh pho, a few herbs and meat – usually either beef or chicken. Ramen, though similar to pho, is a Japanese dish that features wheat noodles served in a meat or fish-based broth that has typically been flavored with soy sauce or miso. Ramen also uses toppings such as sliced pork, nori, menma and scallions. Furthermore, while the clear pho base (which is cooked at a simmer) is made from beef and scented with star anise, cinnamon and charred ginger, ramen stock tends to be darker, richer and cloudy since it’s typically made from pork bones cooked at a rolling boil.</p><p>Before long, other social media users began putting their own two cents in, perhaps causing the Lip Sync Battle cohost to switch sides. “I am going GREAT PHO,” she declared.</p><p>Still, Teigen, whose mother is Thai, wasn’t exactly firmly in the pho camp. When a Twitter follower asked her to choose between average pho and average ramen, she flip-flopped yet again. “Then I choose ramen. So weird,” she explained. “But at its best, there is nothing like a piping hot bowl of pho.”</p><p>After Wale was seemingly flooded with support for ramen, the Cravings author even offered an explanation as to why social media users might be more willing to vouch for the Japanese dish over its similar Vietnamese counterpart. “These people haven’t had good pho, as good ramen is more readily available,” she noted.</p><p>Displaying her ever-present sense of humor, the star later told a follower who asked what makes good pho: “A place with a C rating, truthfully.”</p><p>When Wale later revealed he “found new life wit ramen,” Teigen offered up her favorite variation of the popular soup, replying, “creamy pork tonkotsu broth with bamboo shoots and spicy bean sprouts.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The soup debate came hours after Teigen got into an “actual fight” with husband <a href=#><strong>John Legend</strong></a> over Totino’s pizza. That debacle began after Teigen was “having a Totino’s craving” that entailed a desire for “a pizza from my childhood, with sliced fresh tomatoes on top,” and left it to Legend, 40, to order the meal via Postmates. Apparently unaware that the company makes actual pizzas, the “Love Me Now” crooner ordered Totino’s Pizza Rolls instead, which angered his wife.</p><p>“For 30 minutes we have been discussing how to ensure crispness. I say it needs to be on the rack. He says no it has to go on a pan,” Teigen tweeted, later adding of her spouse: “He thinks I am so stupid I would think tiny pizza rolls go directly onto the rack.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZpygop7AtMWMrZyin5WjerixyKCfrGWZo3qwuoytn55loJ28bsLSZqmapZWjeqWxwZqrnmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
