Although nobody quite knows how long they've been going out, their bond makes it look like they've been together for a long time.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>And so do the things they posted on their anniversary posts. Apatow and Robinson dumped a whole lot of cuteness onto all of us through their posts on&nbsp;their special day.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Iris Apatow and Ryder Robinson Celebrate Their Anniversary</h2><p>Both Apatow and Robinson took to Instagram to post their picks of the special moments they have shared during their time together. It was a nice way of marking their anniversary. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Apatow wrote, "Happy anniversary my sweet," followed by a red heart emoji as the caption for her post. Her caption accompanied four cute pictures and videos.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The first one of those was a selfie by Apatow. The child actress, with a red sweater on,&nbsp;was winking at the camera as her boyfriend faced the opposite way, hugging her.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The next slide was a video of them slow-dancing to a tune, with the red background supporting the romantic theme of what was happening. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The third slide was just a candid of the two, intimate again, as they hid their face with their palms. The bubbles floating around, too,&nbsp;provided some aesthetic distraction. On the bottom right was a date label that read&nbsp;"08/08," but the year it was taken wasn't visible.</p><p>For the final slide, Apatow just put up a video of Robinson, dressed in a light pink sweater and black pants, dancing and vibing to a funky tune. A disco light added to the overall vibe.</p><p>Robinson's post was similarly adorable but with snaps distinct to&nbsp;hers. He posted a picture of the two dressed in matching pink Tom and Jerry t-shirts and a picture from the same time as recorded in the slow-dancing clip she posted. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Iris Apatow and her boyfriend, Ryder Robinson, look cute in matching Tom and Jerry t-shirts.</strong> (Photo: Ryder Robinson/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The other two pictures were of Apatow having a moment with his mother, Kate Hudson, and with his dog. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>"Happy anniversary my love," Robinson captioned the picture, with Apatow responding with an "I love u!" in the comments.</p><p>Both their posts were filled with congratulatory, appreciative comments. Paris Hilton wished them a happy anniversary and Olivia Rodrigo just shipped the couple, writing "irie and rydie" with a few teary-eyed emojis on her post.</p><p>Her mother, <a href=# rel=follow>Leslie Mann</a>, sister <a href=# rel=follow>Maude Apatow</a>, and Hudson, all chimed in with cute messages for the couple, many just using plenty of red heart emojis to express their support. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Iris Apatow and Boyfriend Ryder Robinsonâ€™s Relationship</h2><p>Apator and Robinson first <a href=# rel=follow>went public</a> with their relationship on 2022 Valentine's Day. However, the couple has been dating since at least early 2021.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>When they first made their romance official, an insider confirmed to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">People</a> that the two had grown up together. They even attended the same school in Santa Monica and knew each other for a while.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Since then, neither Apatow and Robinson nor their families have been shy in giving details about the pair. In March 2022, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">E! News</a> reported that Mann was all for their relationship and approved of Robinson. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Maude, too, was supportive of their romance. "She's the first person to be like, 'He's the best,'" Apatow told E! News. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKGinsBurc%2Baq6ivXZa7r7XVnqmsmaKue6nAzKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
