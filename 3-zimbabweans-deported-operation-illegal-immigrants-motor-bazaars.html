They were deported Tuesday morning.</p><p>The immigration officials named the three as Stanley Makombe and his two sons Trevor Tadiwanaishe and Trevor Tanaka who have been working at the firm as sales managers.</p><p>Two Japanese Yusuke Tamano and Yoshifumi Sawada who were the targets vanished, officials said.</p><p>They are being sought. The three Zimbabweans were detained at Kilimani police cells ahead of the deportation for working without work permits.</p><p>Kilimani police commander Moss Ndiwa said the operation was conducted by immigration and that they had been taken out of the country.</p><p>“Those are immigration issues and the suspects are held in cells ahead of other procedures including deportation which I understand has taken place,” he said.</p><p>The three apparently replaced Philippine national Lianie Beth Gala at the yard who was deported in 2020 over claims of money laundering.</p><p>Earlier, the officials had raised Al-Shujah motors in search for the Pakistani owner Hussain Jarrar in vain.</p><p>Instead they arrested his accountant identified as only Yassin. He was released on bond and told to report back to immigration offices on Tuesday for further grilling.</p><p>Jarrar is yet to be found after it emerged his work permit had expired but he is still operating in the country.</p><p>Kenyan security agencies are investigating the wealthy Pakistan national over claims of money laundering and drug trafficking.</p><p>Jarrar, 48 is in hiding after learning he is being spotlighted over his immigration status in the country.</p><p>Jarrar who arrived in the country in 2006 and was later employed as a sales motor vehicle agent is now suddenly a billionaire.</p><p>This has raised eyebrows of the government agencies.</p><p>Jarrar’s work permit expired last year in November.</p><p>He is currently building a Sh1.2 billion mall. He was initially employed as a sales official at Al-Husnain Motors in the city where he earned Sh70,000 up to 2013.</p><p>According to investigations, he has suddenly become a billionaire.</p><p>The Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the Financial Reporting Centre, the Immigration Department and the National Intelligence Service are among agencies investigating him.</p><p>Correspondences seen between the agencies on him show he is involved in questionable deals. He has denied the claims.</p><p>His mobile phone rang unanswered but a woman who responded later on denied the claims adding Jarrar is around and will cooperate with authorities.</p><p>One agency wrote to the other in May 2022 explaining how the man arrived in the country.<br>Jarrar is currently a director at Al-Shujah Motors Limited, which was established in 2012 and started operations of selling second-hand vehicles in January 2013.</p><p>“Previously, Jarrar was a director at Al-Husnain Motors Limited and obtained three of his previous work permits from February 18, 2006 to February 2, 2013. Later the directors of Al-Husnain Motors split and hence the establishment of Al-Shujah Motors Limited by Jarrar,” said part of the letter dated May 19, 2022.</p><p>He in June 2016 made an application as a permanent resident through lawful status which was pending for five years, the documents show.</p><p>In June 2021 he applied for his citizenship by lawful residence when it was established he had an adverse notice due to his suspicious involvement with Iranians.</p><p>“Due to this, his permanent residence process was halted,” the documents say.</p><p>A report by one of the security agencies seen says the company Jarrar runs has been associated with drug trafficking.</p><p>“The referred Al-Shujah Motors changed its name from Al-Husnain Motors whose directors have been associated with drug trafficking,” read part of the report.</p><p>This came out after two of his brothers who doubled as his associates were deported over the same claims of narcotics trafficking.</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57kmaxoqWSlq%2B4scCnqmaclaW8s8DEnWSoqJWnrrW1zqdkoqScmrSiuIyipKahl6eur8DSZqSorJ%2BneqOt2ZqYq6tf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
