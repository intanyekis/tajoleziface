On June 26, the <a href=#>singer announced that she’s engaged</a> to designer Pinkus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The greatest moment of my entire life was saying ‘yes’ to spending the rest of ours together,” <a href=#>she wrote on Instagram</a>.</p><p>“This past month of being your fiancé and being in our own little world of just us two has been so perfect and I wish I could never leave this time,” Noah went on. “I never thought I would ever meet a man like you or someone so selfless and filled with so much love to give.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Elon Musk Says He Won’t Leave His Companies To Any Of His 10 Children</a></span></p><p>“I’ve never felt more loved or in love,” she continued. “I now know the feeling of forever not being long enough. I’m so excited to spend this life with you, our life so far is a life I never thought I deserved or would live.”</p><p>“I never thought I’d be looking forward to living as much as I look forward to living with you. I’m so grateful for you,” Noah added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She accompanied the post with a series of images of herself and Pinkus. The last image in the slideshow gave her followers an up-close look at her new engagement ring.</p><p>There are few details known about Noah’s new ring, but estimates suggest it’s easily worth over half a million dollars.</p><p>Jessica Flinn-Allen, CEO of wedding and engagement ring specialists <a href=#>Jessica Flinn</a>, estimates that the rock is worth at least $600,000. The main diamond is valued at nearly $100,000 individually, she explains.</p><p>“Noah Cyrus’ ring is a diamond set halo on a diamond band, with a round brilliant cut in the centre approximately 2ct centre stone, valued between £50.000 - £80,000,” Finn-Allen said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There’s no word on when Noah and Pinkus are planning to walk down the aisle, but they’re seemingly thinking about a family, given the fashion designer’s reply on Noah’s post.</p><p>“U want kids?” he asked in the comment section, which has racked up hundreds of likes.</p><p>It’s unknown how long Noah and Pinkus have been dating. They debuted their relationship in a TikTok in April but may have been seeing each other privately beforehand.</p><p>Noah implied they’ve been engaged for a while, as she mentioned in her post she’d been Pinkus’ fiancé for “this past month.”</p><p>Noah and Pinkus’ nuptials aren’t the only wedding the Cyrus family will have in the near future. Both of Noah’s parents, Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus, became engaged to other people in recent months after finalizing their divorce last year following 28 years of marriage.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Netflix Threatens To Cancel Harry & Meghan’s Deal If They Don’t Produce Better Content</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>Jessica Flinn</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e82omKFlk66%2Ftr%2BMnqWgmZeasW7AzmanoqabqsBuw8itn2ZuYGV9cXyMq6Cnn12Ws7Wx0WZpZqWfo8GpedGopJqmk5p8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
