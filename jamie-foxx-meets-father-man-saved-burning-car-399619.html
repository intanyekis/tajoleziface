When Kyle’s vehicle was overturned following a collision with a ditch in Los Angeles on Monday (Jan. 18), the actor/singer sprung in to help retrieve him from the wreck. Foxx spoke with <a href=# rel=nofollow>NBC 4 News</a> following the incident, stating that he doesn’t see himself as a hero.</p><p>“I don’t look at it as heroic, I look at it as I just had to do something,” he said. “The way I found about it was, it was about 8:30, and I heard the crash and I heard someone yelling. And I said, ‘You gotta help me get you out, ‘cause I don’t wanna have to leave you.’ And I said, ‘You got angels around you.”</p><p>Foxx also met Kyle’s father, Brad Kyle, who offered a tearful thank you to the actor for potentially saving his son’s life. “I think one would be willing to jump in when it needs to be done, but how many of us really would? Whether this person is famous or not, I’m so glad, so happy,” he said. Though Kyle now faces charges for driving under the influence of alcohol, he also called in to thank Foxx for his helping hand.</p><p>“Just the fact that one human being is willing to help another one means a lot to me,” he said.</p><p>Foxx took to Instagram with a photo of his meeting with Brad Kyle, writing that the two are simply “happy fathers.”</p><p>Met the father of the young man from last night today. This is all that matters. That a man, a son, a brother’s life was spared last night. God had his arms wrapped around all of us…No heroes…Just happy fathers.</p><p>Watch Jamie Foxx and Brad Kyle share a moment in the news clip below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BurrXEZp2osKhiuqax06xkn5mknbKzecyapWarkauypXnBrqmnoZ6ceqSt0WZqcnFmZoZw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
