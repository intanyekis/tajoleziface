Born in Baden, Aargau, Switzerland, Phil Dalhausser attended high school in Florida, and began playing beach volleyball during his senior year. He graduated from the University of Central Florida, where he was awarded the William G. Morgan Award for Outstanding Player. After working various jobs post-college, he relocated to California to focus on volleyball. In 2006, he began playing with Todd Rogers. Rogers, who had been playing on the AVP circuit for eleven years, helped Dalhausser learn the ropes, and the two quickly made their mark. In 2007, they won the FIVB World Championships in Switzerland, becoming the first American duo to do so. They then went on to win Gold at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Going into the 2012 Olympics, they were early favorites, but were subsequently defeated by Italy in the Round of 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKiYnrlusMCln5qto6iys7%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJugqJ%2Bilr2pxYycmKudlad6osPAq5usZZaWsLV5wKebZqSZm7Juv9OoqbJn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
