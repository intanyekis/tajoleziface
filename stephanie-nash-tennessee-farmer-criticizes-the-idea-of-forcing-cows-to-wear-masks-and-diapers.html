Stephanie Nash said the people who came up with the idea have "gone to loony town." In mid-January this year, French dairy giant Danone announced that it intends to put masks and diapers on cows to trap their flatulence and burps in an effort to reduce their&nbsp;<a href=# rel>methane emissions</a> by at least 30% come 2030.&nbsp;</p><p>Nash termed the entire thing <a href=# rel>utter madness</a> on Wednesday, January 18, on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight.' "Well, Tucker, you know, I'm not going to wear a mask. I'm not going to allow my cows to wear a mask," she said, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fox News.</a> During the interview, she even put a mask on one of her cows to test the theory but explained "she's not having it" and is "struggling to breathe."</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Road Warrior's Road to Recovery: Texas woman rescues dog in critical condition from abandoned backpack</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'Captain Kangaroo': North Dakota rep bashed for backing bill to fine trans people using 'wrong' pronouns</a></p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Environmental Protection Agency</a>, livestocks which mainly include cows and cattle, produce methane, which is a dangerous <a href=# rel>greenhouse gas</a> that warms the atmosphere, as part of their normal digestive process. Livestock emissions fom manure and gastroenteric releases account for roughly 30% of the world's methane emissions, according to new data from the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Nash told host Tucker Carlson that her farm is doing "big things to cut emissions." She explained, "We have ruminants on our farm that can digest byproducts. A good example is we feed our cows soybean meal that comes from soy oil production. And you have to ask yourself, millions of tons per year â€“ if we don't have cows to digest that byproduct, it has to go somewhere. It has to go to a landfill. It has to go on, you know,&nbsp;into a waste management. And that's going to be very harmful. That's going to leave an imprint, you know, for our country and gases going into our environment."</p><p>Carlson questioned if putting a diaper on a cow is practical and wondered if the whole thing was a joke. "I think these people have gone to loony town. There's no possible way that I'm going to put a diaper on my cow," she stated.&nbsp;Nash said her cows have to be able to walk around freely, lay down, eat and drink water to live a comfortable life. "Our animals are under the best stewardship, and we want them to be as comfortable as possible. And telling me how to do my job is&nbsp;not the way to eliminate emissions. We have to be smart about this. We have to listen to the farmer [or] rancher and what is best for our animals."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq6SavamtzaKcZqaRqLVuwMSnpZ6ro5qybrLAq6Seql2Yv6rAyJygs52jYsGpsYyim56ZXaSzbrLOq5qippdisLDD0marqGWnmq6zecyaqqSrXZa7pXnDopipnaKo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
