In 2007, Guerin and his wife Fabienne sold the property to Jeff Bezos for $24.5 million. It was the first Los Angeles home ever acquired by the Amazon overlord, who used the place as a part-time vacation residence, per <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It doesn’t appear the Bezos family made any drastic renovations to the property in the 15 years they owned it, but the estate’s value has nonetheless soared. Mackenzie Scott acquired full ownership of the home following her 2019 divorce from Bezos; when she donated it to the CCF over summer 2022, the organization valued the estate at $40 million.</p><p>Since the property was never officially on the market, details and photos are few. But tax records reveal the main house has seven bedrooms and seven baths in about 12,000 square feet. On the premises are a movie theater, expansive terraces for al fresco entertaining, and parking for upwards of a dozen cars. From the street, big gates and tall trees render the entire property virtually invisible from public view.</p><p>Proceeds from the $37 million deal will go towards “affordable housing projects and an immigrant integration program,” per the CCF.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to his impressive new mansion, Caren and his wife Maira still own their current Beverly Hills home — a smaller Spanish-style residence in the Flats area of the city, acquired back in 2010 for $4.5 million. As for Bezos and his longtime partner Lauren Sanchez, they’ve upgraded to a $165 million mega-estate elsewhere in Beverly Hills, and have a superyacht and multiple other vacation homes spread across the world.</p><p>Scott, for her part, reportedly continues to reside in Seattle, where in 2019 she paid a city record $37.5 million for a modernist home in the exclusive Hunts Point neighborhood.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>Kim Kardashian And Kanye West Reportedly Attend To Saint’s Football Game</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmajnZabeqOx2aiqZp6fp7qmvoyeqq2ZpJp6qrqMm5yvnaKhxm60yKWjrGWTlrmqss6rpaKZXai8rbCMn6arZWNseq61y6WgqKZf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
