There is so much opportunity and money out there that it should never be an issue where you couldn’t find the time to help anyone in need. No matter if they are a newbie, veteran or just someone passing by.</p><p>This is one of the main reasons why I created ZacJohnson.com, to help others and get them started with the online money making process.</p><p>In addition to meeting a ton of people over the years and getting featured on <a href=#>ABC and FOX news</a>, I’ve also had the opportunity to take part in a lot of fun promotions.</p><p>Nothing else! No email, no subscription, just a quick submit button!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Vote-for-Me.jpg alt="Vote for Zac Johnson" width=550 height=330 sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>So what’s this contest all about?</strong></p><p>The promotion is being run by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>RevenueWire</a>, which is an affiliate network that specializes in software downloads such as data recovery, spyware removal, tech support and much more. They also have some nice payouts in the 75% range, which delivers very high ECPCs. Great for pop unders, media buying and on site traffic campaigns.</p><p>There are three winners in their contest, which are for the top affiliate in their network (revenue), another is for the affiliate with the biggest increase in revenue, and the last for the top blogger who gets the most votes.</p><p>The winners will walk away with a sweet all expense paid trip to Miami which includes an exciting speedboat racing event, helicopter tour, a stay in the amazing Fountainebleu hotel and much more!</p><p>Bottom line… I’d love to have your vote to walk away as the winner of this contest. BIG Thanks!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunCtjK%2BmrZ1dm7yzecyeZKKrXZZ6t7vTnmSfp6JivbO70qmcq6Gkrnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
