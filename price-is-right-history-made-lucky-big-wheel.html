The price was astonishingly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statistic-smashingly fortunate</a>&nbsp;on Wednesday when two contestants managed to spin a double lucky big wheel spin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're not a fan or regular watcher of The Price Is Right, here's the scoop: a spin that lands on the $1 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spot is very rare</a>. While it might not seem like much, most of the other spots on the wheel are mere cents.&nbsp;The $1 spot actually earns a contestant lucky enough to land on it $1,000 which is a nice little win but if the same contestant happens to land on it again during a second spin, the contestant wins an additional $25,000.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">And on Wednesday, that's exactly what happened</a>. Twice. Two different people who were chosen from the audience as the show's contestants for the day happened to land on the $1 spot twice, netting $26,000 each. The fact that this happened twice to two separate contestants <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">set the Twitterverse ablaze</a> with chatter.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">5 Famous (And Infamous) Lottery Winners And Enthusiasts&nbsp;</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One user wrote, "The chance of two $26k Wheel winners on two shows is ~0.23% (1 in 440), and the chance of a second $26k winner across two shows provided youâ€™ve seen a first is ~2.5% (1 in 40)."</p><p>Other fans of the show on Twitter talked about how no one could recall this ever happening before on the any of the nearly 70-year-old's show's history. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Some fans mentioned</a> that the chances of the double lucky $1 spin times two happening might have been helped because the show aired a The Price Is Right at Night special episode later the same day in addition to the regular episode. A contestant named Kiara Thomas won the double lucky spin during the regular show and contestant Jack Zager won the same spin sequence during the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">evening's special episode</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zager's first spin actually resulted</a> in 40 cents, then 60 cents on the big wheel before he hit the $1 spot - then managed to do it again. During Thomas' first "toss up prize", she successfully <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bid the correct price</a> on the item which earned her $500. When she got to the wheel, she spun 20 cents, then 80 cents, then $1 plus an invite to the Showcase Showdown. On her bonus spin, she landed the special $1 spot once more.</p><p>While they weren't on the same episode together, the fact that they each won the incredible spin sequence during the same day amazed fans.</p><p>Both Thomas and Zager made it to the Showcase Showdown segment of the show which is impressive. But Zager's time ended there when he overbid (by $32). Thomas fared better and walked away with a total of $54,549 in prizes which included a Miami vacation plus a new car.</p><p>If you're feeling lucky vibes after reading this, don an attention-grabbing T-shirt, try your luck and come on down!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;8 Biggest Pay-Per Views Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NYPost.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">decider.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FoxNews.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS9s7XCnmSiq12ntqi002afoqukpL%2B6ecyam55lnKqwrMWMm6CgZaedsqa4jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
