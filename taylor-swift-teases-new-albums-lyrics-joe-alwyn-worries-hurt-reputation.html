Some theorize it’s a reference Taylor's relationship with Joe, once radiant like the sun, now eclipsed by darkness, or literally a break-up. Others posited that the line "crowd goes wild at her fingertips" symbolized her song-writing prowess. With the album's launch imminent, on April 19th to be exact, the snippet served as an ideal appetizer get fans geared up.</p><p>Joe Alwyn Is Reportedly Worried About How Taylor’s Album Will Depict Him</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar51510266-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, one person who likely isn’t excited about the drop is Alwyn. Reports say the low-key <a href=#>actor is nervous about the backlash</a>, considering Taylor’s reputation for using her songs to share her perspectives on past relationships. For example, Taylor even had to recently ask fans to be kind to her ex John Mayer after he started getting renewed backlash when she played “Dear John” on her Eras tour, a decade after their brief relationship.</p><p>“It’s safe to say that Joe is bracing himself for a lot of questions.

"It’s called The Tortured Poets Department and I’m going to go post the cover right now backstage."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keeping her word, Taylor quickly took to Instagram and revealed the album's cover art, depicting her lounging on a bed in elegant black lingerie. Accompanying the image were handwritten verses, teasing other potential lyrics from the much-awaited album.</p><p>"And so I enter into evidence my tarnished coat of arms. My muses acquired like bruises, my talismans and charms,” the lyrics read. “The tick, tick, tick of love bombs. My view of pitch-black ink. All’s fair in love and poetry… Sincerely, The Chairman of the Tortured Poets Department."</p><p>Fans even believe the album’s name is a reference to Joe Alwyn, so it looks like Swifties can expect tea to be spilled in Taylor’s upcoming music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lpJqutLHSZqWer12WuaPBzKxkpbGinrC0ecmonGaZnKzGr3nWqKmroZWoeqnB0a1kq52gqsGiwMiopWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
