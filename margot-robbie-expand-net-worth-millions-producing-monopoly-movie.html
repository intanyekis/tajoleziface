The revelation came to light at CinemaCon, with Robbie's production company, LuckyChap, joining forces with Hasbro Entertainment and Lionsgate for the project.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/margot-robbie-movies-2024.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>These Are The Highest-Grossing Margot Robbie Movies</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Margot Robbie's future is bright, as she continues to dazzle Hollywood with high-grossing blockbuster films.</span><p>Robbie established her own production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, in 2014, alongside her husband Tom Ackerley, and their close friends Josey McNamara and Sophia Kerr.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since its inception, LuckyChap has become known for its commitment to producing diverse and compelling content across various genres. One of their most notable projects is I, Tonya, a biographical film that earned critical acclaim and garnered multiple award nominations, including an Academy Award for Best Actress for Robbie's portrayal of Tonya Harding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/margot-robbie.jpg><p>LuckyChap's track record, particularly with the recent success of Barbie, speaks volumes about their capability to handle such projects. With Barbie reigning as the highest-grossing film last year, raking in $1.4 billion at the box office, expectations are understandably high for the Monopoly adaptation to surpass even that success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film has the potential to not only be financially a huge success at the box office, but at a personal level for Margot. It's unclear if she’ll have an acting role in the Monopoly movie, especially since she’s been vocal about wanting a break from being onscreen. But even if she’s just producing, it could mean a million dollar pay check for Margot, given what she made for Barbie.</p><p>It's been reported that Margot made $12.5 million up front for being the titular character in Barbie, but she went on to <a href=#>make an additional $50 million</a> from her role as a producer, given how lucrative the film was around the globe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before the film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robbie had a reported net worth of $40 million</a>. So, if the reports of her making $50 million from Barbie were accurate, that means she may have doubled her net worth. And it appears it’ll be only up from here if the Monopoly movie is just as successful. Plus, reports say Margot’s company has another project in the pipeline- an adaptation of the Sims video game – only enhancing her portfolio as well as her net worth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmppminLy1edGomZuhlWKyubzAp5tmppWperi70a2fZqWZobmqu82sZKmqn5nCpLXNoGSmp56kvbC42GakqK6Zmnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
