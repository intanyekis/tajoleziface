I would think any of our friends would say that when they need love and affection and a genuinely non-judgmental person and ear to talk to, they go to Lucie, because she has a very motherly instinct already without having had kids. It’s very natural.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lucie_debuted_her_growing_baby_bump_at_the_CMA_Awards></span>Lucie debuted her growing baby bump at the CMA Awards<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The singer-songwriter, 45, debuts her tiny baby bump at the 2022 CMA Awards after the couple confirms they were expecting twins.
