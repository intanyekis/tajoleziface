A few weeks before Glastonbury, Niall was spotted at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Harry Styles’</strong></a> concert at Wembley Stadium. Niall was seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>jamming out and singing along</a> to Harry’s song “As It Was” and the One Direction hit “What Makes You Beautiful.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>One Direction was formed after their run on The X Factor. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Zayn Malik</strong></a>, 29, announced his departure from the band in 2015. Later that year, the other band members announced they were taking a hiatus to pursue solo projects.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Back in 2021, Niall admitted that he still talks to members of the band. “<span>Still talk to them all the time,” he said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Jonathan Ross Show</a>. “We still keep in touch. Everyone’s having their own success on their own like that.

I’d love for there to be a time where it felt like something we all wanted to do,” he said on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spout podcast</a> in June 2022. The Grammy winner later added, “I think we all went through something really special together and there’s a lot of love there. So, yeah, I think if there’s a moment for us to do it the right way, I think it’d be great.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>On The Jonathan Ross Show, Niall was also game for a reunion if it could happen.&nbsp;“If everyone wanted to do it, I’d be down for it,” the “Slow Hands” singer said. “They’re probably slim right now, currently. We need to all get in the same room and have a chat. I don’t know when that would be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FyZqWnpZ7AbsDOpqOipqOku266yJqjpWWYpL%2Biuoygo5qrpKS7o8HRsmSrnaWjtrC6jKmfqKyfqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
