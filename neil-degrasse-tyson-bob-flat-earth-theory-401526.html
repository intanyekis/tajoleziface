Once again, famed astrophysicist <a href=# id=auto-tag_neil-degrasse-tyson_2 data-tag=neil-degrasse-tyson>Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> opened up his book of knowledge to chapter “Earth Is Indeed Round and Here Are the Facts To Prove It” during an appearance on The Nightly Show.</p><p>After B.o.B.’s unwavering theory that our planet is flat, and after Tyson provided evidence and reasons as to why the rapper’s beliefs are false, Bobby Ray still stood firm in his thoughts, but maybe this epic breakdown by Tyson will make him think differently.</p><p>“Listen B.o.B., once and for all,” he begins. “The Earth looks flat because, one, you’re not far enough away at&nbsp;your size. Two, your size isn’t large enough relative to Earth to notice any curvature at all. It’s a fundamental fact of calculus and non-Euclidean geometry small sections of large curve surfaces will always look flat to little creatures that crawl upon it.”</p><p>Before dropping the mic (literally), Tyson also referenced a statement from world-renowned physicist, Isaac Newton: “If I have seen farther than others, it’s by standing on the shoulders of giants,” he quoted. “Can I get an amen? So that’s right B.o.B. When you stand on the shoulders of those who came before, you might just see far enough to realize the Earth isn’t fu**ing flat!”</p><p>Before Tyson made a public appearance on the occurrence, B.o.B. took his claims a step further and laid out his thought process on a reported diss track titled, “Flatline.” His tweets on the matter previously solidified his theory, writing, “A lot of people are turned off by the phrase “flat earth” … but there’s no way u can see all the evidence and not know … grow up.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>A lot of people are turned off by the phrase “flat earth” … but there’s no way u can see all the evidence and not know… grow up</p><p>— B.o.B (@bobatl) <a href=# rel=nofollow>January 25, 2016</a></p><p>Welp, Tyson definitely has the evidence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyqriMnZygqpGowKZ507KqqKZdl7yjecWlmK1llZa%2FtbSMrZ%2Bep6KuenV8kG5pb2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
