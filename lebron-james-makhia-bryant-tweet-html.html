Our beloved&nbsp;Lakers&nbsp;star is&nbsp;no exception to this neoliberal culture.&nbsp;James initially tweeted a photo&nbsp;on Tuesday, of the white police officer Nicholas Reardon, who is said&nbsp;to have killed Bryant.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>James also tweeted the message,&nbsp;“YOU’RE NEXT #ACCOUNTABILITY,” along with the photo; with&nbsp;an hourglass emoji symbolizing the long-awaited&nbsp;decline and fall of the systemic violence that the minorities have always faced.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>ANGER does any of us any good and that includes myself! Gathering all the facts and educating does though! My anger still is here for what happened that lil girl.

He admitted to being rather furious with the system, which caused him to make the angry tweet that so many of his audience found to be inappropriate.</p><p>The truth is, like everyone else, he is also incredibly tired to see the death of black folks through the hands of very those who are supposed to protect them.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>I’m so damn tired of seeing Black people killed by police.&nbsp;I took the tweet down because its being used to create more hate -This isn’t about one officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;it’s about the entire system and they always use our words to create more racism.

His words were not targeted to a single officer, but to a whole corrupted system, and people were offended by virtue of their own misinterpretations.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Right around the time the tweet was deleted, the police also effectively released a bodycam footage of the shooting in which Bryant, who appeared to be holding a knife. She refused to comply when told to "get down," and ended up clashing&nbsp;with two other black girls her age,&nbsp;before the officer shot at her four times.</p><p>Further, the city authorities initially stated how&nbsp;Reardon&nbsp;intervened after someone from the house called 911, reporting&nbsp;that they were being threatened physically. He ended up shooting the 16 year old to death, in order to&nbsp;"save" another girl who Bryant was apparently&nbsp;on the verge of attacking.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>On a similar note, stars have taken to twitter and other social media to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">express</a>&nbsp;their grief over Bryant's death, namely: Zendaya, Jada Pinkett Smith, Elaine Welteroth, Amanda Gorman, and Justin Bieber. Also,&nbsp;Beyoncé&nbsp;shared a photo of Bryant, who was in foster care at the time, to her own <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>, saying, "We mourn the young life of Ma'khia Bryant."&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Like all these celebrities, staying firm on the belief that the police shooting was wholly unethical and unjustified, James has been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">accused</a> of channeling his inner Maxine Waters, by many republicans and conservatives alike.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiqqaeiqcBwuMSbqaimXZ%2BurrHSZqSao5ierm6u0bKYp6xdqcSmsdNnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
