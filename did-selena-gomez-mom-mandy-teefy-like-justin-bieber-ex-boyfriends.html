It's possible that this caused a lot of stress and made it tough for the pair to make it. It couldn't have been easy for Gomez to hear what her mom had to say.</p><p>But since the couple was so young when they dated, that could be why they broke up for good.

Since Gomez and Bieber were together for such a long time, that's only logical. It does seem that Mandy Teefey had an opinion on Gomez dating The Weeknd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Ace Showbiz, there was a report that Teefey didn't think that Gomez should be with The Weekend. A source explained in an interview with Hollywood Life, "Selena's family is so incredibly supportive and loving. She has a big extended family and they all support her. When she was struggling they showered her with love constantly. They helped her get back on her feet and solid ground."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/the-weeknd-abel-tesfaye.jpg><p>However, when The Weeknd shared a photo of him and Gomez at the Met Gala, Teefey seemed pleased.

Mama is happy XO."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When people noticed that Teefey had shared her opinion, she said, "Yes, I am happy my daughter is happy," according to Elle.</p><p>It doesn't seem that Mandy Teefey commented on Selena Gomez's relationships with Taylor Lautner or Nick Jonas. From what she has said about The Weeknd and Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez's mom seems to care about her daughter's mental health. And it's only logical that if she sees that Gomez is having a tough time in a relationship, she wouldn't be on board. Any parent would want to help their child through a situation that was making them sad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/selena-gomez-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Selena Gomez hasn't had a perfect bond with her mom Mandy Teefey over the years, her mom definitely cares about her. In 2022, Teefey was interviewed on the podcast On Purpose that Jay Shetty hosts. She said that she wasn't going to see Gomez's documentary My Mind And Me because it would be challenging and upsetting. In the movie, Gomez talks about having lupus and bipolar disorder.</p><p>Teefey said, "We went through that and found healing. We've moved past some of it, and even if it's something she went through, and I didn't know she went through it, as a mother, it's going to affect me. It's going to hurt my stomach and put me in that mindset. I'm going to wish I could go and protect her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqLKtsc2aZKCnnZrHbrnOpmSmmZ6Zxm7AxJ6dsmWcnrimecmuqq2hnmKvqrHBnqlmnahir7DFxaugnqaUqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
