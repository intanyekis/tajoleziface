Keep reading to find out.</p><h2>Why did Mel B leave America’s Got Talent?</h2><p>The former Spice Girls member will not be a judge on Season 19 of America’s Got Talent because she was only tapped for the franchise’s new spin-off America’s Got Talent: Fantasy League, which had its inaugural run this past winter. Instead, Sofía Vergara, who sat out of Fantasy League, will be returning for her fifth consecutive season. She will be joined by longtime judges Heidi Klum, Simon Cowell and Howie Mandel, who all participated in Fantasy League. Terry Crews will also be returning as host.</p><p>Mel B, whose real name is Melanie Brown, previously served as a judge on the flagship series for Season 8 through 13. She left in 2019 to go on a world tour with the Spice Girls and <a href=# rel=noopener>was asked back in 2024 for Fantasy League</a>, which saw judges face off against each other as they drafted dream teams of fan-favorite contestants from across the AGT universe.</p><p>“I love being part of the&nbsp;AGT family,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Glamour</a> ahead of her return to the franchise. “I did seven years, and then in 2019 I came back to the UK because Spice Girls was going on tour, and I never went back. I set up home here with my kids and put them in school in my hometown, Leeds. So when I got asked to be back, it just so happened I had a break in my crazy, hectic schedule. I was like, Oh my God, this is perfect timing.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AGT.jpg alt="America's Got Talent judges" width=1351 height=788 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Her fellow judges were thrilled have her back, with Cowell telling the singer during the Fantasy League premiere: “Can I be honest with you? I’ve actually missed you.” Klum, who is very close with Mel B off-screen, added: “I know, me too! It’s like getting the family back together.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>More:</strong> America’s Got Talent judges’ real-life partners</a></p><p>Vergara never revealed the exact reason <a href=# rel=noopener>why she bowed out of&nbsp;Fantasy League</a>, but it most likely had to due with filming schedule of her Netflix limited series Griselda, in which she starred as the titular character Griselda Blanco. Host Terry Crews announced the latest spin-off during Season 18 and revealed on air that Vergara would not be participating as a judge. The Modern Family alum then added, referencing Mel B: “I had other things to do! But I’m going to leave you in good hands, I’ve found the perfect replacement.”</p><p>It’s unclear if Mel B will continue on Fantasy League next season or if Vergara will come on board, but as of this writing, the spin-off has not been officially renewed or canceled by NBC. The decision will likely be announced during or after Season 19. In the mean time, fans are happy to have Vergara back and the actress appears to be excited as well. Ahead of the May 28 premiere, she shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">photo of herself</a> back on set, captioned: “Season premiere of AGT season 19 is TONIGHT!! 🤩💃 Watch at 8/7c on nbc🦚.”</p><p>America’s Got Talent Season 19 premieres on NBC on May 28 at 8 p.m. EST and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><strong>For more on America’s Got Talent, check out this gallery on <a href=# rel=noopener>every winner ranked</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvY2eCc4COsJ%2ByZZ2auW6ujKWcmq6VYq6usdGimpqrXZy8tXnTmqOepqRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
