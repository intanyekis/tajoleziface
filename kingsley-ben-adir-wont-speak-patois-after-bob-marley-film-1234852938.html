He also stressed the importance of perfecting the Patois language spoken in Marley’s tropical homeland, as it was a challenge to learn for him.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The only thing Bob and I really have in common is that, you know, he has a white parent and a black parent, and he’s mixed,” Bed-Adir started. “So, I just felt like, yeah, I don’t sing, I don’t dance, I don’t speak Jamaican Patois. I, you know … I just want to make sure everyone knows.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“There was a real commitment to the authenticity of how Bob spoke,” he continued. “There’s a respect that I have for the language where outside of set when I wasn’t surrounded by Jamaicans who were able to direct and help, I just wanted to keep it sacred, you know? And the language was the one thing that the studio and <a href=#>the family </a>convinced me at the beginning was going to be the most important.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">To prepare himself for the iconic role, he recalled practicing Patois and the guitar in-between filming<a href=# data-type=pmc-gallery data-id=1234772573> Barbie</a>, where he played a Ken doll. “I was just finding gaps and moments to start, you know listening to Bob and learning Patois and playing the guitar,” he added. “So as soon as Greta [Gerwig]&nbsp;called cut, I would just kind of run behind a mojo dojo casa house and do some Patois.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ben-Adir also admitted that, out of respect for <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234777422>Jamaican language and culture,</a> he would not speak in Patois following filming.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He also recounted taking a little over a year to perfect the Jamaican language, which was taught by a team of seven to eight language experts on set.&nbsp;The 38-year-old also got fully into character donning a replica of Marley’s iconic locs — which took months to recreate.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_bob-marley-one-love data-tag=bob-marley-one-love>Bob Marley: One Love</a> premiered in theaters on Feb. 14, and also stars&nbsp;Lashana Lynch, James Norton,&nbsp;Tosin Cole,&nbsp;Anthony Welsh,&nbsp;Michael Gandolfini,&nbsp;Umi Myers&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nadine Marshall.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Check out Kingsley Ben-Adir speaking on the film above and its official trailer below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6C2r7PSpZyyZZKau26tw6KpZq%2Bfo8Fuv8%2BemKRloJbBsLXSZpifrJWneqO7wWakmqqcmsZussilpGZpYmiBeYGRcmpxZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
