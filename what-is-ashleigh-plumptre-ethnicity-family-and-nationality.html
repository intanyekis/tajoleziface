The former England junior international Plumptre chose to represent Nigeria at the senior level. The February 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations was her debut. She will debut for the Super Falcons in the FIFA World Cup on July 21, 2023. Plumptre started playing soccer on May 8, 1998, with Leicester’s Asfordby Amateurs.

One might argue she’s Afro-British. Nigeria includes 371 ethnic groups, with the Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbo being the most populous. Most Nigerians are “Yoruba” or “Hausa,” the majority of the minority population.</p><p>Different ethnicities live in different locations in Nigeria. Nigeria’s racial and ethnic diversity increased with population. Yorubas had the most population increase. Ashleigh’s ethnicity is needed to establish her roots.</p><p>She probably belongs to one of these ethnic groups given Nigeria’s demographics. Her birthplace is England, but her roots are in Nigeria, which intrigues her followers. She is Nigerian and plays for the National Women’s Team.</p><h2><span id=Ashleigh_Plumptre_Family>Ashleigh Plumptre Family</span></h2><p>Plumptre’s family helped her get into soccer early. Plumptre started playing at four, inspired by her father, a sports fan. Father Tim Plumptre gave the center-back Nigerian citizenship.</p><p>Tim is partially Nigerian because his father is Yoruba from Lagos State. However, his mother is British. Tim was born in England but is British and Nigerian. Plumptre’s FA-registered middleman father was born on June 10, 1970. That means he may represent English footballers and clubs in Intermediary Activity.</p><p>Tim married Jo Plumptre on April 24, 2010. His daughters are Plumptre and her younger sister. The soccer player’s father’s wife is Jo Plumptre. Ashley Plumptre was born to Tim and his ex-wife. Her divorce with Tim left Plumptre’s mother out of the picture. Jo played mother to the soccer player.</p><p>Bayleigh Bisi Plumptre is Ashleigh’s younger sister. The sisters are father-related. Bayleigh Plumptre was born on May 26, 2010, to Tim and Jo. The younger sister has a different skin tone than her older sister, despite being Nigerian. Bayleigh started drumming at six and is a passionate player.</p><p>She studies Trinity Grade 8 Rock & Pop Drums at the London Institute. In an interview, the player said the sisters recently discovered their Nigerian heritage. Her sister and grandfather taught Plumptre Nigerian culture.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kaylin Wiley</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Averie Gilley</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sophierosejm</a>.</strong></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Katy Kellner | Shannon Sharpe’s Rumored Wife</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Who Is Sharon Vallas | Meet Paul Vallas Wife | Married Life And Net Worth</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfrLWiwIyiqmaZo525prXGoWSppKWivbW%2BxGacraCenrCqwNhmnZqlmaHGbq3NnWSnmaSevK%2Bty6Krsmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
