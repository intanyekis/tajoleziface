Her 10.86 time was impressive, of course, but she also charmed fans with her signature style — and the adorable hug she gave her grandmother after her win.</p><p>“Without my grandmother, there would be no Sha’Carri Richardson,” the athlete said during a press conference after the trials. “So my family is my everything. My everything until the day I’m done.”</p><p>In July 2021, however, Richardson’s Olympic dreams <a href=#>came to a possible halt after she tested positive</a> for THC, a chemical found in marijuana. As a result, she was hit with a 30-day suspension and her results from the Olympic trials were disqualified. Her suspension will stretch beyond the beginning of the Tokyo Olympics, but there’s still a possibility she could compete in the 100-meter relay race.</p><p>“I just want to take responsibility for my actions, I know what I did,” the runner said during an interview with <a href=#>Today</a>. “I know what I’m supposed to do and what I’m allowed not to do, and I still made that decision. But I’m not making an excuse or looking for any empathy in my case.”</p><p>Richardson, <a href=#>who has been very vocal about her mental health</a> battles, told <a href=#><strong>Savannah Guthrie</strong></a> that the recent death of her mother had been a “very heavy” topic for her to deal with while competing in the trials.</p><p>“People don’t understand what it’s like to have to — alright, people do,” she explained. “We all have our different struggles. We all have our different things we deal with, but to put on a face, <a href=#>to have to go in front of the world and put on a face</a> and hide my pain, I don’t know. … Who am I to tell you how to cope when you’re dealing with pain? Or you’re dealing with a struggle that you’ve never experienced before? Or that you never thought you’d have to deal with?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The track star said that she learned of her mother’s death from a reporter, who told her about it during an interview days before the trials were set to begin. “I was just thinking it would be a normal interview,” Richardson told Today. “But to hear that information coming from a complete stranger, it was definitely triggering, it was definitely nerve-shocking.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to learn more about Richardson:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKmtwpqpq6Fdp7aktMCrm6ynnmKCbsDHoqWgq12pvG63zaiuZpmWqbKzec6lsKaomZjAbrDRmqSaZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
