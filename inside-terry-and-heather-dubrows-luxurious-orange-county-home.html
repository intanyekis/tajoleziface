The pair have made a name for themselves in Terry’s E!

The pairs oldest daughter Max has <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">come out publicly as bisexual</a> and Katarina recently shared she was a lesbian. The family says they love serving as a platform for what they call 'normal' and modern family values.</p><p>Most recently, the Dubrow’s have launched a new reality television show, 7 Year Stitch; a seven-week course in personal improvement and marriage advice. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">E! Entertainment</a>, the show gives couples struggling, an opportunity to fix their situation and the Dubrow’s 25-year marriage gives them plenty of experience to help others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When not filming or planning their next conquest, the Dubrow’s are busy <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">renovating and decorating</a> their home. Check out the special features in their modern Orange County family mansion.</p><h2 id=construction-on-film>Construction On Film</h2><p>The couple documented the construction of their $21 million, Crystal Cove property. The 22,000 square foot mansion they dubbed “Dubrow Chateau” on the RHOC series was featured on the series premiere of RHOC this year, though they’ve never completely revealed the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">luxurious amenities of the home</a>.</p><p>What we knew for sure was the 40,000 square foot property included ocean views, an in-ground pool, palm trees and a trampoline for the kids. Heather had chosen to design the interior on her own. In fact, the pair made the agreement that Terry wouldn’t interfere in anyway and it appears both are happy with the arrangement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=walking-through-the-front-doors>Walking Through the Front Doors</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, visitors can spot fresh flower arrangements around a grand piano and large artwork on the walls in the foyer. <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Trees are a central theme</a> throughout the home, from the olive trees the Dubrow’s had brought in for the courtyard of the house, to an etched glass window in the dining area.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">John Legend & Chrissy Teigen Offer Fans Sneak Peak Inside Their Renovated Home</a></span></p><h2 id=teens-live-here>Teens Live Here</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the subterranean level of the home, an entire space is filled with a game room. There is pinball, pool tables and a horizontal row of televisions giving off a bar/club vibe and 21-seat movie theater with reclining chairs and large movie screen takes the décor up a notch. Pocket doors open the level up to one large space for get-togethers according to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>.</p><h2 id=adults-need-space-too>Adults Need Space Too</h2><p>Upstairs, a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">champagne </a>wall adorns the dining room, including a six-foot trough in the kitchen island that can be filled with ice and champagne for parties and other events.</p><p>The couple’s master bedroom has animal print carpeting, neutral bedding and wall art.
